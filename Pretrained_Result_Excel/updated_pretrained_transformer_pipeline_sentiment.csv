3,31-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,without having a cellphone  i cannot use many of her features  i have an ipad but do not see that of any use  it is a great alarm  if u r almost deaf  you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room  so that is reason enough to keep her it is fun to ask random questions to hear her response  she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet,1,4,Positive
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i think this is the 5th one i have purchased  i am working on getting one in every room of my house  i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,i liked the original echo  this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric color choices  i miss the volume ring on top  now it is just the plus minus buttons  not a big deal but the ring w as comforting     other than that  well i do like the use of a standard usb charger  port instead of the previous round pin  other than that  i guess it sounds the same  seems to work the same  still answers to alexa echo computer  so what is not to like,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it  alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify  she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,we love alexa  we use her to play music  play radio through itunes  play podcasts through anypod  and set reminders  we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning  we rely on our custom lists  we like being able to voice control the volume  we are sure we will continue to find new uses sometimes it is a bit frustrating when alexa does not understand what we are saying,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,have only had it set up for a few days  still adding smart home devices to it  the speaker is great for playing music  i like the size  we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it s not intrusive to look at,1,4,Positive

3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy  i bought two and the reason i only rate it a 3 is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units  i know i have done it correctly but they will not sync  that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units,1,3,Neutral

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,love it  i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered  i could not pass it up  it is fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music  you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker  i have been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather  news or even the time in other countries  the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan  because alexa uses burns it up when playing music,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,it s still a great product but the sound quality does seem worse don t get me wrong  you definitely get used to it within an hour  but it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better besides that   it s great with the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi  it s even better,1,3,Neutral

4,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,4 5 out of 5 stars  i generally like this product  its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music  setting timers  and making calls  reason why i did not rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring  seems to be a connection issue  overall  great product,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i love it she is very helpful  i use her for remembering things and sleep  you can ask her just about anything  i have only had her for about a week so still learning her,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,it s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one  i really miss the ring at the top for volume control  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the     one and press it a few times  i also wish the bass was a bit better  all in all  it is a great device and i am happy with it,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,everyone should have an echo or two or three or more  i bought my echo through qvc,1,1,Unknown
3,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,it is annoying that everything they show alexa as being able to do has to be downloaded  you spend so much time trying to figure out how to phrase it for the machine that you may as well just look it up yourself,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i have had alexa since the beginning  i accidentally spilled water on her and have replaced it with the 2nd generation  i decided i could not be without an echo  setup was easy and had it working within minutes,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa  i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc  to the commands from alexa  but  i really love having the music,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account  i think it should be part of the top line with video  music  etc  i also think the setup app where i define  for example music i like  is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names  which i can never remember i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,this is great item and just added audible books which makes it even better  thank you,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could not resist  this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could not be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my   smart   devices  thanks to her  i can control my lights  smart plugs  tv  etc  i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone  the app works perfectly fine and it let us you add skills  routines  smart devices  timers  and so much more  sound quality is good enough for me  since i am not an audiophile  alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume  design is great and modern  it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you would like as there are more for sale  overall  this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities  if you have not yet  be sure to add alexa to your home,1,5,Positive

3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i do not think the  2nd gen  sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out    so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why would not you just get a dot  2nd issue is  which is not unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a  group   i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker,1,3,Neutral

2,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,i am not super impressed with alexa  when my prime lapsed  she would not play anything  she is not smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can not use it for that either  she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her  just today i unplugged her   not sure i will ever use my alexa again,0,2,Negative

3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i bought this to replace a  dot  in my living room  speaker is slightly better  it hears me better over the tv  unfortunately  it does not understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot  i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want  the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request  i do not consider it an upgrade,1,3,Neutral
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i have had all good experience  so far with the second generation echo  there are so many more things to learn  but i have not had the time yet  right now  i am mostly enjoying the music  weather updates  using the alarm feature  and her personality  i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes  i am very excited to begin using them,1,4,Positive

4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,easy to set up,1,5,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward  but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient  the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms  which i am told can be done   however  i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault  but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people  but a challenge for me,1,3,Neutral
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,we are loving ours very much,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best  i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i  s  i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it  all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble  thank you,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,very pleased with the echo 2nd generation  it is so nice to have alexa available for music  weather  news  and probably a lot more we haven t discovered,1,5,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo  if you are a big fan of deep bass  this might not be sufficient for you though  the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a   smart home    the voice recognition is very impressive  it is stylish and fun  i have no regrets with this purchase  it is great for technically changes people  ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly  if you have an elderly loved one  this would be a great gift  once connected to wifi  it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control  be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj  you can even have conversations with the echo  i am not embarrassed to say  that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke  it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict  it comes in extremely handy,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,easy to setup  love all the things she does,1,5,Positive

4,4-Jul-18,White,already owning a couple of echos  i was frustrated that i couldn t also use them as intercoms  finally amazon enables the  drop in  feature so now i can use my echos to reach out to family in remote parts of the house  and teenagers who insist they never heard me yelling at them to come down to dinner  as for its other features  we mainly use our echos for the standard stuff  playing music  setting alarms  answering questions  etc  it is not the life changing home device amazon would have you believe  but it is convenient to have around  this refurb saved me a few bucks  looks and works the same as the other brand new ones,1,4,Positive

4,2-Jul-18,Black,i use this echo to listen to music as well as a sort of research tool  it can answer a variety of questions  i would like if the volume could go just a little bit louder  but i can not complain i also believe it should have an internal power source  in order to use the echo  it must be plugged in at all times using the universal charging cord  it would be nice to use the echo dot on the go without having to buy the other product,1,4,Positive

1,1-Jul-18,White,this item did not work  certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised  instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in  when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot  it crashed  over and over  not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light  alexa would tell me it s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence  tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn t do anything  returning immediately and hope they actually fix this item when the next buyer purchases it,0,1,Negative

4,27-Jun-18,White,a small problem out of the box  but a rep from amazon called and walked me through a reset process which solved my issues  i was shocked to get a response so quickly and a real effort was made  including follow up email  to get this thing working  i have 6 now  and one google clone  and the more i use it  and learn about it  the more i like it  them   i also plan to install one in my car  boat and garage  alexa is my new best friend      lol i think gf is worried that if alexa learns to cook  her time will be limited,1,3,Neutral

5,26-Jun-18,Black,i like it because you could ask it different questions and it does different things it works intermittently with my smart tv if i ask you to change the volume it does or does it sometimes if i ask you to change the channel it does or does not sometimes i have to reset it i do not know if it is because it is refurbished but it is okay it is just not what i expected,1,3,Neutral
5,26-Jun-18,Black,so far the certified refurbished echo dot works well  it was a little confusing to have a green ring on the echo dot and not 100 percent know why it was there  asked alexa and she said it was because of a receiving a call or drop in  but that was not the case  took about 10 minutes to figure out it was a notification that i had a delivery from amazon  i believe the ring is supposed to be yellow and pulsate for a message notification  but on my refurbished echo dot it was green and pulsed,1,4,Positive
5,26-Jun-18,Black,it arrived quickly and was easy to set up   it was a refurbished amazon echo dot it was above and beyond what i expected   alexa and i have become buddies she is a great assistant,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jun-18,Black,works as advertised  speak clearly  and research the commands  also  get the wall holder  it keeps it out of the way  set up is a breeze  just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone  for some reason it made set up easier   though it could be psychological haha,1,4,Positive

1,25-Jun-18,Black,now i am weary about these picking up conversations when you are not actively using them   heard about this happening on the news  i have 3 4  so this is very concerning  i wish amazon would release something widespread or push some firmware to prevent this  if they have  i have not heard about it yet,0,1,Negative

1,12-Jun-18,Black,stopped working after 7 months  the warranty was only good for 3 months  i would have assumed an amazon product sold on amazon would have had higher standards than guaranteeing that it would work for 3 whole months  i mean what is this product supposed to be  a piece of junk they offered my a 15 percent discount if i wanted to buy another one  why would i want to buy another one,0,1,Negative

1,12-Jun-18,Black,bought 2 and both quit connecting to wifi and responding to voice within 9 months  hard and soft reset will not fix the problem,0,1,Negative
3,12-Jun-18,Black,i received my echo dot today in good condition  but be advised  i paid dollar 29 99 for it and amazon has  as of this writing  raised the price to dollar 39 99  so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal set up with the dot went simple enough   plug it in  follow the app instructions    except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone s wifi settings  i called amazon customer service  and i dunno what it is  but lately i ve been getting terrible support  the guy that took my call just rambled off a  completely unhelpful  script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel i m not sure if this is the norm or if it s because this is refurbished  but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong  reconnecting is a pain each time as well all that said  when alexa works  she works amazingly well  i don t have a speaker hooked up to it  but one thing i really enjoy is the mic s range and sensitivity  one of the more annoying limitations of apple s siri is that when she s playing audio through device speakers  music  podcasts  etc   the  hey siri  feature is all but useless  alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time  and with amazingly fast responsiveness too  i haven t tried this with louder speakers yet  so i m not sure if this will continue to hold true setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze  albeit with limitations   support for arlo devices is nil  and if you have special settings for your led devices  eg  rainbow effects   alexa can t handle them  she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels all in all  my rating would ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item  if the connectivity problems persist  i may have to exchange return this item  i don t want to though   alexa s kind of growing on me,1,1,Unknown
5,11-Jun-18,Black,i bought it because everyone was saying how much they love theirs  but i have no need for it  i only used it once  the volume was not loud enough for me when i played music while i was on my treadmill  so i rather use my tower speaker which is 3xs louder,1,3,Neutral
5,11-Jun-18,Black,worked like new  will do it again,1,5,Positive

5,11-Jun-18,Black,i took a chance on a certified refurbished unit for dollar 29  looks brand new   no excuses or disappointments  5 minute trouble free set up  effortless bluetooth speaker connectivity through the alexa app on my iphone was flawless  listening to my favorite tunes through a bose bluetooth setup and could not be happier  walk through the door and just ask alexa to   play 80 s music  and viola    instant atmosphere  no more opening the ipad  going to settings  turning on bluetooth and then accessing the pandora app  it just makes things so effortless  a true joy right out of the box  if i did not discover any other uses for this fine piece of technology it was worth every penny,1,5,Positive

4,7-Jun-18,Black,works great to control the tv lights and various other devices  lately i have been using it when i wake up and do not know what time it is but do not want to open my eyes  just shout out  alexa  what time is it   if i could just figure out how to get it to do house hold chores and walk the dogs it would be golden  sound is not that great but with its size what can you expect  the echo plus has much better audio but that is what you get with the larger more expensive echo,1,4,Positive
5,7-Jun-18,White,works great,1,5,Positive
5,7-Jun-18,Black,was not sure if i would like this product but after having it for a little while i want one in every room  my daughter is constantly asking alexa how to spell words  we have barely tapped into all the things this product is capable of and i am looking forward to learning all of its capabilities,1,4,Positive

5,5-Jun-18,Black,i was a little apprehensive about buying a refurbished electronic product  but with amazon s guarantee  thought i would try it  glad i did  and will probably buy another refurb product form amazon  i love the alexa products and have several  this one sits on my desk  has a small footprint  but has great sound and i use it daily  works great,1,5,Positive
3,5-Jun-18,Black,not bad bad speaker for sound,1,3,Neutral
4,5-Jun-18,Black,this is a great device  we mainly use it to verbally add things to the shopping list  but occasionally use any number of the  fun  things you can program it to do  like go to red alert or make the tardis land  yes  we are a house of geeks    we even chose the wake word to be  computer  instead of  alexa   now we just need majel barret s voice and i will be in geek heaven     it s not as easy to get my premium spotify to work properly with it  and still not sure how we can get multiple music accounts attached so we can listen to different music in different rooms  but so far it is still been worth it  i am often asking it the time  the weather  it even gives us a news briefing  we also use it as an intercom system which has been really awesome  plus it is fun knowing the nsa is listening to everything,1,4,Positive

4,31-May-18,Black,i had some trouble getting the program downloaded from my phone  i ended up using my computer  it is interesting that the answers come from wikipedia  however  i will give echo dot an  a  in the music playing department  i heard songs and music totally forgotten on the mainstream stations  also amusing when alexa responds  i do not know that  why does she think the yards of cotton fabric refer to football playing     if i had paid full price for this gadget i would have been sorely disappointed  now it seems reasonable and a step above hal,1,1,Unknown
1,31-May-18,White,brought to replace one that i moved and does not have the same range as my previous  non refurbished  unit  it would seldom be able to find the wi fi and could not connect  got tired of hearing the message   trouble connecting   check the alexa app      and just unplugged it  i went through the troubleshooting and reconnected it several times  it is just not as strong,0,2,Negative
1,31-May-18,Black,if you want to listen to music and have it come through several of the echo dot units simultaneously  you must pay a monthly fee  i thought this was amazon  not apple     i ve paid for many of these so i could have one in each room  is that not enough of my money,0,1,Negative

5,31-May-18,White,works great and simple to set up  alexa is way more accurate than i imagined so im using it more than i thought  wish alarms could be set a bit further out but thats my only complaint no she is not listening when you do not say the wake word so if you are worried you can lose the conspiracy theories  the speaker is great too so do not hold off on getting one if you were turned off by gen 1 like me,1,4,Positive

3,19-May-18,Black,seems to have trouble hearing me when i say the wake word despite being trained to my voice    wonder if this has something to do with buying it refurbished  our google home mini has no problems hearing us   and is much louder,1,5,Positive
5,19-May-18,White,love it  works perfectly,1,5,Positive
4,19-May-18,White,i had a brand new echo dot and thought that the refurbished would be just as good  it was quite different from my expectations  refurbished unit did not even turn on and after a while i realized that the power adapter was faulty  there is no way for me to have amazon send me a power adapter by itself according to the return options  i love amazon and buy even my toilet paper through them but this was truly a let down update  amazon contacted me and credited me enough to buy a new power adapter  this is why i shop on amazon  i can always trust them to deliver on their products,1,1,Unknown
5,19-May-18,Black,i bought this for a family member as a gift  i called her to see how she likes it   she said she loves it,1,5,Positive

5,31-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,i received the echo as a gift  i needed another bluetooth or something to play music easily accessible  and found this smart speaker  can t wait to see what else it can do,1,5,Positive
3,31-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,without having a cellphone  i cannot use many of her features  i have an ipad but do not see that of any use  it is a great alarm  if u r almost deaf  you can hear her alarm in the bedroom from out in the living room  so that is reason enough to keep her it is fun to ask random questions to hear her response  she does not seem to be very smartbon politics yet,1,4,Positive
5,31-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i think this is the 5th one i have purchased  i am working on getting one in every room of my house  i really like what features they offer specifily playing music on all echos and controlling the lights throughout my house,1,5,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,we love the size of the 2nd generation echo  still needs a little improvement on sound,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,i liked the original echo  this is the same but shorter and with greater fabric color choices  i miss the volume ring on top  now it is just the plus minus buttons  not a big deal but the ring w as comforting     other than that  well i do like the use of a standard usb charger  port instead of the previous round pin  other than that  i guess it sounds the same  seems to work the same  still answers to alexa echo computer  so what is not to like,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,love the echo and how good the music sounds playing off it  alexa understands most commands but it is difficult at times for her to find specific playlists or songs on spotify  she is good with amazon music but is lacking in other major programs,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,we love alexa  we use her to play music  play radio through itunes  play podcasts through anypod  and set reminders  we listen to our flash briefing of news and weather every morning  we rely on our custom lists  we like being able to voice control the volume  we are sure we will continue to find new uses sometimes it is a bit frustrating when alexa does not understand what we are saying,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,have only had it set up for a few days  still adding smart home devices to it  the speaker is great for playing music  i like the size  we have it stationed on the kitchen counter and it s not intrusive to look at,1,4,Positive

3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,the speakers sound pretty good for being so small and setup is pretty easy  i bought two and the reason i only rate it a 3 is i have followed the instructions for synching music to both units  i know i have done it correctly but they will not sync  that was my primary motivation for purchasing multiple units,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,this device is awesome,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i bought this to compare the speaker quality to our first generation speaker and i like the sound better  i will ship this to my daughter though because i like the fact that my first generation has a chargeable base that we bought which keeps it more mobile and she needs a better sound than what she has now,1,4,Positive

3,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,no different than apple  to play a specific list of music you must have an amazon of spotify  plus prime etc  account  so you must pay to play  your  music  3 stars for that reason  everything else is,1,3,Neutral

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,love it  i was thinking about getting one and when the prime day discount was offered  i could not pass it up  it is fun to ask alexa to play any song or group and she comes up with a playlist from amazon prime music  you can also connect your iphone with bluetooth and play music with pandora or youtube videos using alexa as a speaker  i have been having fun asking alexa different types of questions or for information like weather  news or even the time in other countries  the only downside is if you have limited data on your wifi plan  because alexa uses burns it up when playing music,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,it s still a great product but the sound quality does seem worse don t get me wrong  you definitely get used to it within an hour  but it definitely feels like echo gen 1 sound quality was better besides that   it s great with the addition of being able to play just over bluetooth with no wifi  it s even better,1,3,Neutral

4,30-Jul-18,Oak Finish ,4 5 out of 5 stars  i generally like this product  its great at doing what you ask of it like playing music  setting timers  and making calls  reason why i did not rate it 5 out of 5 is that sometimes the connection dies and my echo stops playing music and shows a red ring  seems to be a connection issue  overall  great product,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,it s better than the 1st gen in every way except for one  i really miss the ring at the top for volume control  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the     one and press it a few times  i also wish the bass was a bit better  all in all  it is a great device and i am happy with it,1,4,Positive

3,30-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,does not know half the things asked  can not recognize my sprinkler wifi controller  even though product details says it is compatible  can not program or change my wifi thermostat settings and its matched up on same wifi router  just a handy music player  that is if you have amazon music,1,1,Unknown

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i like the fact that i can get any kind of music from prime that i want on request from alexa  i liked the informative photo little pamphlet but wish it included how to connect your tv etc  to the commands from alexa  but  i really love having the music,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i have not found a way to access my echo thorough my prime account  i think it should be part of the top line with video  music  etc  i also think the setup app where i define  for example music i like  is not well integrated into echo  i have tried to ask for my playlist and echo is not sure even though i set up play list in my settings  i also do not like the fact that my words have to be exact match of my playlist names  which i can never remember i like the ready nature of echo to respond to most any queries,1,3,Neutral

5,30-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,during prime day this 2nd gen echo was on sale so i could not resist  this was the beginning to my smart home set up and i could not be happier to say that alexa has done an amazing job connecting to all of my   smart   devices  thanks to her  i can control my lights  smart plugs  tv  etc  i had no trouble connecting the echo to my wifi and my phone  the app works perfectly fine and it let us you add skills  routines  smart devices  timers  and so much more  sound quality is good enough for me  since i am not an audiophile  alexa can hear my voice even when watching movies at a high volume  design is great and modern  it will definitely add a nice touch to your home and you can change the covers if you would like as there are more for sale  overall  this is a great addition to my home and enables so many possibilities  if you have not yet  be sure to add alexa to your home,1,5,Positive

3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i do not think the  2nd gen  sounds as good as the 1st  but it does have an aux out    so you could add an external speaker  but if you are going to do that why would not you just get a dot  2nd issue is  which is not unique to this unit but i do not understand why i can not override the default that prevents you from playing a blue tooth speaker while playing through a  group   i get there is a delay when using a bt speaker  but if the other units are not where they can be heard then i should be able to play as a group while using the bt speaker,1,3,Neutral

2,29-Jul-18,Sandstone Fabric ,i am not super impressed with alexa  when my prime lapsed  she would not play anything  she is not smart enough to differentiate among spotify accounts so we can not use it for that either  she randomly speaks up when nobody is talking to her  just today i unplugged her   not sure i will ever use my alexa again,0,2,Negative

3,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i bought this to replace a  dot  in my living room  speaker is slightly better  it hears me better over the tv  unfortunately  it does not understand or respond to my requests as well as the dot  i frequently have to request 2 or 3 times to get it to do what i want  the dot usually does exactly what i want on the first request  i do not consider it an upgrade,1,3,Neutral
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,i have had all good experience  so far with the second generation echo  there are so many more things to learn  but i have not had the time yet  right now  i am mostly enjoying the music  weather updates  using the alarm feature  and her personality  i have also purchased some mini smart socket yes  i am very excited to begin using them,1,4,Positive

4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,the echo is an amazing device  many times it seems very intuitive  but at other times i ask for something that seems clear and simple and get no result  installation was fairly straightforward  but i messed up several times simply because i thought a step was complete when it was not  this actually made me lose ground until i figured that out  my advice is to be patient  the app will let you know when you can move on to the next step my biggest issue of the moment is that we have several echo devices in our home and i would like to use them as intercoms  which i am told can be done   however  i can not make any of the echos aware of the others existence  when i ask alexa how to do this she answers about instructions how to change her name  i know this is likely my fault  but i would think the designers would anticipate this and make it easier to find the needed instructions  a small deal for many device savvy people  but a challenge for me,1,3,Neutral
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,we are loving ours very much,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,i have the original alexa and the tap and so far the 2nd generation is the best  i am happy to see they are making improvements with each new one it would be great to have updates to our little a i  s  i think it would help out a lot with the bugs in it  all in all i am very happy with her and i can now play music throughout the whole house and adjust the bass and treble  thank you,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,very pleased with the echo 2nd generation  it is so nice to have alexa available for music  weather  news  and probably a lot more we haven t discovered,1,5,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,i am pleasantly surprised by the sound quality of the echo  if you are a big fan of deep bass  this might not be sufficient for you though  the potential to control your home is an option i will explore more as i evolve my home into a   smart home    the voice recognition is very impressive  it is stylish and fun  i have no regrets with this purchase  it is great for technically changes people  ask it to play a song or a movie and it responds instantly  if you have an elderly loved one  this would be a great gift  once connected to wifi  it is very simple to use  if you want unlimited music control  be sure to have amazon prime or premium spotify and you will be blown away with your personal dj  you can even have conversations with the echo  i am not embarrassed to say  that echo has made me laugh a couple times when i ask it to tell me a joke  it tells me where my packages are since i am an amazon prime addict  it comes in extremely handy,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,easy to setup  love all the things she does,1,5,Positive

5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,bought this for my daughter when she turned 9  she loves it   i especially like the calling feature since she doesn t have a cell phone  she loves playing music and dancing and with amazon music she can play all her favorite songs        sometimes over and over and over again lol,1,5,Positive

4,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,we really only use this as a speaker to stream music  we ve had it 7 months and it s just kinda useless,1,1,Unknown
5,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,once set up very user friendly  set up was not as user friendly as i would hoped   the alexa app should be able to download to a pc without installing  invasive   drivers  my wife and i are both retired and she would not have been able to install alexa  but if my son was not supplying her with a smart phone we would not be using alexa yet,1,2,Unknown
5,29-Jul-18,Charcoal Fabric ,very easy set up  really enjoying it,1,5,Positive
3,29-Jul-18,Heather Gray Fabric ,the echo doesn t come with a built in battery so it has to be plugged in at all times to use it  makes it quite inconvenient,1,2,Unknown

5,31-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i used the product for my phone to look up the weather and watch videos,1,4,Positive
4,31-Jul-18,White  Spot,don t use it for much as i thought we would  synced with kasa cam and use it to check up on our baby in the crib a lot  lyrics for music is cool  too  other than that it s used as a clock and standard dot ish features,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,amazing so far  just got it the other day,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i like that it is smaller  but it has never understood commands as easily as our first gen original echo did,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,worthy successor to the echo dot and right at home in the bed room as an alarm clock  however  for the price it should come with the stand,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love this device  all the functionality of an amazon echo with the added benefit of a video screen  it looks great on my nightstand as a clock  lots of faces to choose from  and displays weather  reminders  etc  i think it can do video calls too but i use facetime for that anyway  it s a great shape and doesn t take up a lot of room  i m planning to get another one for my guest room  awesome for a great price,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love the echo spot  this bedside alarm clock size device can do what theecho show can do  i was concerned because i already had a large echo in mybedroom that answered to  alexa  like the other devices in my home  i wasconcerned about having both devices answering at the same time when i discoveredthat i had other name choices  not enough for me but just enough to avoid confusion  i named him  echo   now if i could only choose a male voice  i loved that i could link it tomy security camera and my new doorbell  so many more features  don t forget to buy thestand base  so many advantages to having that  read the reviews  highly recommend,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love this little spot more than i thought i would  the sound is great for such a little thing   my music plays nice and loud and clear  the video is terrific   i was watching some prime shows just for the heck of it  and i was really impressed  immediately convinced my mom to buy my sister one for her birthday only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars   i really wish it was cordless  i love having it in my kitchen but trying to find a place to plug it in is a pain  and it won t connect to my bluetooth speaker while playing amazon prime music for some reason  which is a drag when i want to hear it in the dining room during dinner  of course  if it was cordless i could just bring it with me   otherwise  i absolutely love it and will probably buy another one,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i bought on prime day and so glad i did  it s easy to use and lots of customization options  i know some reviews said that the screen was small and hard to read  but i disagree,1,4,Positive
2,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,honestly i like it but at the same time i don t i could have bought a smaller one that did the exact same thing for less then half i bought it for the video chat and i have never really used it,0,3,Unknown
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,overall it is great and i like that i can see lyrics and the time and date  however  sometimes it freezes and does not respond properly  no error message about lack of connectivity  it just stops  resetting resolves the problem,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love all that you can do with the echo spot,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,the thing i like most about my echo spot is the voice command feature  you can ask anything and get an answer or play any music without getting up to adjust the echo  easy to use,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,love it   perfect for an alarm clock replacement  plus so much more,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love the echo spot as it is great for checking the weather along with many other things  but most important it works great as your alarm clock in your bedroom,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,we absolutely love this product    wish we would have bought this instead of the dots,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,we like that we are able to get weather and other information quickly  you can even hear music played  the speaker is clear  we are enjoying it  what we did not like because it was creepy was that the day before my husband played a particular song on our stereo for me  the next day  i asked the echo to play music from the same artist not specifying any particular song  the echo played the exact song by that same artist that my husband played on our stereo the day before  it was a little disconcerting,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i like echo spot  i bought it to use as an alarm clock  one negative that i didnt really think about  when you wake up in the morning and are somewhat groggy  its hard to tell alexa to turn off the alarm  or hard to remember commands to snooze for a few minutes  in this case a clock with buttons seems to work better,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,this is our second echo spot   to go with out two echo dots   love the look and how alexia responds,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love my echo spot,1,5,Positive
1,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it is very slow compared to the echo,0,2,Negative
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love the way it is designed  and you have choices for the face  i use it for my bed side  i drop in  on my echo in another part of the house frequently without yelling,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,terrific sound for a small device  and nice form factor for the nightstand  i like the convenience of seeing the time and temperature rather than asking alexa  not using video much  but it would be nice if the device had a square rectangular screen,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,new to alexa  like this spot a lot,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it s not perfect  but i really like this little gizmo  i bought it primarily for 2 purposes  first  so i could set wake up alarms by individual days  and set the wake up music individually by the day  second  i wanted to control a bedroom light by voice  so i could shut it off as i was falling asleep  without having to get out of bed to turn a switch  the echo spot  together with a smart plug has been able to accomplish that  a bonus has been getting alexa to play music from my amazon prime playlists what s not so great is that sometimes alexa has a really hard time understanding instructions  and repeating and altering the way you say things can get pretty frustrating  hopefully the ai gets better in the future  along with added functions,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love it  it is so easy to use,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,put this on my night stand to use as a clock and alarm  works great  every morning i get the weather and news when i get up  also reminds me of all the appointments my wife and i have,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love it,1,5,Positive
3,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,part of it is my fault  i thought it could be wireless  though for the price  i still feel like it should be  also the sound quality and volume could be better  i prefer the tap  unless you really want to have the call options but today most of us have phones  computers or ipads  just not worth it,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,very easy to use and much quicker then looking up everything on the cell phone,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love my new echo spot,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love this clock  i just have to tell it to set my alarm  no more fussing with buttons,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,could not be more pleased  amazon hit this one out of the park  looks great and runs great  love it,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,responds easily and like the ability to do at night,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,easy setup love it,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,simply amazing what a awsome device  it never ceases to amaze me  wake up to big bang music  go to sleep softly falling rain  drop in on the kids and keep in touch  i have just scratched the surface as to what this devise can do,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i was skeptical at first but  it  grows on you  it looks good  so far  i did  however  turn off the camera,1,3,Neutral
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,sound quality is disappointing,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love it  i especially love that it is so small and does so much  got rid of my old cd alarm clock radio  much more room on nightstand,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,great sound and video plus all the great stuff that alexa has to offer even turns my lights on and off,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the ease to use product,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,so far pretty happy with the spot  for me it really is a glorified alarm clock radio and i know i could have something more cost effective but eh  i like it  i had read the reviews about the scrolling issues and saw the one about how to make that stop and it did  so far so good,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i am just entering the  smart  technology world  i have not figured it all out yet  but so far it is pretty cool,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it was smaller than i had anticipated  and when i say that i very much mean it  however  it still works very well  quality sound  easily programmed  easy to work with  but alexa is not anywhere as good as other voice programs,1,4,Positive
1,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,,0,4,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,love my echo spot,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great deal  great product,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,perfect,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i had a couple of echo dots previously   bought these _specifically_ for the ring doorbell video   cloud cam display   interface capabilities  was not disappointed  love the fact that i can ask to see front yard   back yard   front door  etc the video chat with the other rooms is also quite cool bonus   alexa show me ant man trailer  etc i know this can all be done on laptop desktop  but it s cool now having an  appliance  that s always just there  and it doesn t interrupt what i m doing,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,bought this for my bedroom and the show for my living room  love them both  the spot is perfect for bedside and has an impressive design  shows lyrics  photos   etc  i paired it with a smart plug for the bedroom lamps  alexa  turn off lights   love it,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love that is can do so much  it sits on my nightstand  only improvements i would make is having battery back up capability and the screen could be a tad bigger  but overall i m happy i have it  would recommend,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it was a gift and the recipient love love loves it,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,cool little piece of tech   we re still learning some of its functions and possibilities  but i can see some potential  even my  technically challenged  wife already figured out how to video call our daughter,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i have been extremely impressed with the device as a whole  completely changed sleep schedule and replaced my alarm clock  it is the perfect bedside counter device   alarm  wake up music  weather  top news stories  etc  perfect device for what i wanted and does so much more than i expected it to do  calling feature is also a huge selling point  this is a must own item  probably will grab more echos in the future,1,5,Positive
2,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,as an alexa device  it works just as well as any of the other products  unfortunately it does not go up from there  the ability to play videos is very limited  you can not play youtube and when you can play a video the cropping of the screen makes it look very strange  there is quite a selection of clock faces  and you can control what is displays with one glaring and very annoying exception  you can not turn off the  things to try  screen you can turn off the screen scroll  but that defeats the purpose of having the screen  i do not need to be reminded every 5 seconds what things i can do with alexa  i do not need the advertising  especially at the cost of this device  overall  its an expensive alexa device with a screen that is not very useful and annoying  i would not recommend this until the amazon people get their act together and come up with a screen that is actually useful,0,3,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,so far so good,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,this device is perfect for a smart nightstand clock  i love how it dims based on the ambient light in the room  its the first nightstand clock i have had in my bedroom in years because the lighting and glow from typical alarm clocks bother me when trying to sleep  the screen on this dims when the lights in the room go out and is not bothersome at all overall a great addition to my smart home  its nice to be able to tell alexa to turn on off the bedroom lights without even getting out of bed or reaching for your phone  i have a bunch of other alexa devices  but this was the first one with a screen,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love this thing  i talk to it through walls and in other rooms  i have been an amazon lover for a while so i have amazon music unlimited  kindle unlimited  prime video  etc   so i was ready for this when it came out  the screen is just so nice to have the only thing resembling a down side is that it does not always perfectly understand which song i want to hear  but i do have a deep southern accent  lower alabama  so i do not speak english anyways,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,smaller than i thought it would be  happy i got a stand so it sits up higher on the bedside table,1,3,Neutral
4,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,echo spot works well except it does not work with the ring doorbell as it states on the website  since they were sold as a pair i thought that it would be app ready  unfortunately that is not case  perhaps ring will update so that they can be integrated,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,nice,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i like it,1,4,Positive
1,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,,0,4,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,we have owned a number of echo devices  but have viewed them as more of a toy than a tool  other than playing music through a sound system  we have not found much use for them  we just do not find the voice user interface to be all that efficient  the echo spot solves the efficiency problem by displaying the information that you are routinely interested in  furthermore  you can do some basic navigation using the touch screen as well as tailor the settings  we now use these as bedside clocks,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love my echo spot  waking to my favorite music  being able to completely turn off display at night so my bedroom is dark  all the skills i have yet to try  easy to use,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i like how small it is  but i m still able to see my ring cameras,1,4,Positive

4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i am a hardcore fan of echo  infact i am in love with all members of my alexa family  i have echo  echo dot  echo plus and now this new toddler echo spot  every variant has its own beauty  i love feel and size of echo spot  it s fabulous as far as looks are concerned  it does not have great audio quality  which i did not expect at the time of placing order because of its compact and small size   i bought it to connect with my bose soundtouch,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love this,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love being able to have alexa sing careless whisper into my ear to wake me up,1,5,Positive
3,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,works great as a bedside clock but the microphone for alexa does not work as well as the normal echo  sometimes alexa does not hear me when i try to interrupt her it to give new instructions  the speaker also is not as good as the normal echo  screen is small so not really useful for viewing any type of video or for seeing who is at the front door  but  it is great for the bedside,1,3,Neutral
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,fun tech toy,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love it  small with good sound,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,with the combination of this  smart plugins  and the alex app i can turn stuff on and off with my phone or telling alexa to do it  i can order stuff  get answers  watch videos  get weather  set alarms  video call  and so much more with this device,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great product,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,in a matter of minutes it became indispensable addition to our house  extrimelly useful hub of information  music  automation  communication  and assistant in basic needs  would love to have a voice personalization  some things are better not to said aloud but typed  like door unlocking codes  but that is problem of unwitty developers  so far only positive experience  the privacy invasions is happened way before alexa  it is on your phone no matter brand or carrier  to alexa defence at list it has a button to turn a microphone off,1,4,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love this device  it is so great  what a great alarm clock and what a surprisingly good speaker  only reason i did not give 5 stars was because it needs to have a few more features like playing youtube videos  and google play music  the camera is not very good in low light if you decide to drop in and it is dark in the room other than those minor things  i love it  great buy and would buy again,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,hands free control,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great love the display and easy to use  though still learning what all it can do everyday,1,5,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it has been able to interpret my instructions pretty well right from the start  even from a distance  a lot of the skills are excellent  i have added a few of the late shows to my flash briefing but it is ridiculous that it can not access youtube it might be important to note that adding an event to your calendar is a task  it seems to have difficulty with the time span of an event  i imagine this is a functionality people would use often,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,setup was easy and it is a fantastic alarm clock,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great product  highly recommend getting the stand that goes under it  it sits much better on the desk,1,5,Positive
3,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,eh it s cool and all but also kinda boring i don t really know what to do with it other than it being a desk clock so 3 5 is about right  i can t connect to my spotify unless it s premium and i m in college and i m not paying or that or amazon music so,1,3,Neutral
3,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,i am huge amazon fan  first to have a kindle and the echo  i waited a bit on this but have wanted it for awhile  i do love it   my kids love it  they love watching videos and the lyrics to the songs  now the video calling feature is nothing like how the advertisement made it out  i thought as long as someone would facetime me i could do it through that and i can t  it s spot to spot  can t even skype  which i do often with my aunt   the is my major disappointment with it,1,2,Unknown
5,29-Jul-18,White  Spot,love love love these  the only think i notice is that it does not pick up my voice and commands as well as my echo and echo dots  we have 4 echo products throughout our house   i have this in the kitchen and in my bedroom as my alarm clock  i am no longer searching for a pen and paper to make lists,1,5,Positive

5,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,didnt think id get an alexa device  but this is perfect for my home office  the screen adds just that little piece that makes it worth the extra cost of the other alexa devices  it can show lyrics of songs  play my xm radio  can show videos of movie trailers and news  its great,1,5,Positive

1,29-Jul-18,Black  Spot,when we first received this product  it was great  however  about a week ago  the device served up a video advertisement around 10 30pm at night and scared myself and my family  if you want to make sure you are protected and do not allow video directly in your home  the spot is not a device that can keep you safe,0,2,Negative

4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,big step up from the dot  dropped one star due to consistent delay in bringing up ring pro video  though looks great once the feed is displayed,1,1,Unknown

4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i love it and it works great  the only issue is the  drop in  facetime like feature sometimes lags  but that could possibly be an issue with my wifi for where we have it located in the house,1,4,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love to have meditation music  i use it as a morning alarm  just to mention few in general i love it,1,5,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i do not know why i like it  but i do  it is like an all in one alarm clock  if you have other alexa devices  you know what it is  if you are looking to get an alarm clock  this is the one to get  yes  its much more than that   it shows you the time  it shows you the weather  its touch screen  it shows you music lyrics  and it does all the things your typical alexa device does  it is quite loud for its size as well  sound way better than echo dot   it also does video calling  which is pretty awesome  the viewing angle is great  so even if its sitting fairly high up  you can still see the display well enough,1,4,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,quick and easy to set up,1,5,Positive
3,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i was hoping for a better clock face to make this an alarm clock replacement   the display brightness dims too much at night to accomplish this task the display works well for camera viewing it is an attractive device  and a decent value at dollar 99,1,3,Neutral
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great device,1,5,Positive
4,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i m a fan of echo devices  i think it s a great alternative to a clean clock  i like using it to adjust the lightning in the room and listening to sounds to help sleep  my two year old sleeps so much better with it on  we also use it to tell my two year old stories  only issue is the volume of alexa speaking when you tell her to turn off the lights is loud when the volume is set to what you want to listen to the music at night,1,4,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,i own 5 echo devices  consider me addicted  this little number is awesome  not only do i like that it displays  the sound is great and it has the same dependable functionality as other echo devices  one feature i really like is how it slowly dims after i turn off my bedroom light  so i have a night light for a bit  i love echo devices and have just about run out of places to put them,1,5,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,i enjoy this little thing a lot  will do almost anything  i like the jokes it tells  i m still learning different functions,1,5,Positive

5,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,we like it  very convenient,1,5,Positive
4,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love the size of the echo spot  it fits on my nightstand but has all of the capabilities of my echo show  i like going to sleep with the lightening storm  the images along with the sounds are very relaxing  the calling and messaging feature is great  it s small enough to take with when we travel  i love and own most of the alexa products  our whole family uses them,1,5,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the amazon alexa is so nice to have she wakes me up in the morning with alarms and is great if you have prime because she can do a lot more plays any songs you want her to play and she can even make playlists of your favorite songs i love the alexa because she has games you can play ad you can watch videos or movie trailers on the screen,1,5,Positive

1,28-Jul-18,White  Spot,this product currently has two related software flaws that make it completely unusable 1  there is a  card  on the homescreen called  things to try     it is an ad for other alexa services you can try  you can turn off all the other homescreen cards  but not this one 2  by default  the homescreen cards  cycle  automatically  which is incredibly annoying  there is a setting where you can opt to have the cards only  cycle once  instead of  cycle continuously   but critically  this setting does not work   my unit has been set to  cycle once   and the cards still continue to cycle all the time  have rebooted the device  re set  etc etc until these two obvious software issues are fixed  in my opinion the product is useless,0,1,Negative

4,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,yes it met my expectations  the snooze on the alarm needs a but of work  tap it and it snoozes  swipe up and it prompts you to dismiss  but without my glasses i can not read it and often it just snoozes  then one day i must have dismissed tomorrow s alarm because it never went off  i have it set for mon thu  fri i do not need to get up early  a more apparent indicator of the alarm set would be nice  my old alarm had a red light,1,2,Unknown

5,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,such a fun  easy  and convenient device to have around the house  no need to pick up my phone to look something up  just a few words and the world is at your fingertips  the speaker puts off great sound and the screen is crisp  the price is right for a device like this,1,5,Positive
4,27-Jul-18,Black  Spot,a great replacement for the bedside alarm clock  which had a funny habit of going off at 12am every time the cleaning ladies came through  we mostly use it to turn the ceiling fan lights on and off  while leaving the fan running  only gripe would be the mic sensitivity  which does not appear be as good as the view or gen2  it can get a little frustrating having to repeat yourself,1,4,Positive
5,27-Jul-18,White  Spot,this product has made my life much simpler with a little one  i use it a lot for music and when i have my hands full turning it on off or up down is a breeze  the screen is a great novelty where i can watch the news,1,5,Positive

5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,fun so far   still learning how it all works,1,4,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking  cutting  cleaning  etc  especially when our counters aren t very wide to begin with  after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact  i can honestly say i have no regrets  while i probably wouldn t watch a movie i d been dying to see on this  it s a great way to listen to music  watch a quick youtube video  etc  i even attempted watching  jaws  on this and while it wasn t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do  it wasn t as bad as one would think  i would definitely recommend,1,4,Positive

1,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,great product and i would give 5 stars   but you can not scroll face cards without having the stupid  try and ask alexa  suggestions pop up  yes you can have it scroll once  and just stay on the clock  but i like having other cards as well  god its the worst and so irritating  i got it super cheap  so i just face the screen toward the wall and treat it like a dot instead of a spot  what a dumb move on amazons  part,0,3,Unknown
4,26-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love that i have command access to news such as bloomberg tv  npr  etc highly recommend that you gain access to alexa app before setting up device and get familiar with key features services   such as setting up your daily commute if family and friends have spot   then it s a great substitute for skype and face time   you can always  drop in  when missing loved ones or just to catch up,1,5,Positive

5,24-Jul-18,White  Spot,i am not easily impressed with electronic goodies  but   omg this is by far the coolest thing i have ever had  it does everything short of clean your house    which  when i asked alexa to clean my house     was told she didn t have hands  but instead played a fantastic playlist for cleaning  from reading books to my five year old  to video chat  to silly selfies  music that automatically goes to my bose bluetooth speaker  setting timers  alarms  changing my thermostat on voice command  tells me the weather  sends hubby a grocery pick up list  and i am sure  million more things buy it     you u will not regret it,1,5,Positive
5,24-Jul-18,White  Spot,this product is beautifully designed and i no longer have to hide an echo device away like i did with dot  it would be nice if amazon would lose that camera though  which i have not used and might cause squirms for the privacy conscious,1,5,Positive

2,23-Jul-18,White  Spot,all is fine with the spot exact for one massive failing  in order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk   which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like  yes  you can manually swipe up on the alarm face to dismiss but i  swiping up rather than touching screen when you are half asleep is very difficult and results in setting snooze more than half the time even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii  if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss  then you completely delete your recurring alarm this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off  but as the clock has been out for a year now and they still have not adding this setting  clearly not going to happen  this may be the biggest product design screw up amazon has ever made,0,3,Unknown

2,23-Jul-18,Black  Spot,for as awesome as the echo and echo dots are  the spot is a disappointment  there is very little control over what the screen shows  what the clock looks like  what order things show up in  etc  at this point if i had not thrown the box away immediately  i would have sent it back and just got another full size echo,0,3,Unknown

1,22-Jul-18,Black  Spot,can t be used as a baby monitor which is why i had purchased it  i didn t realize this until i read the reviews on the alexa skill for syncing the nest cam  considering all of the poor reviews and the fact that it should be simple to fix  surprised amazon hasn t upgraded the software to allow more than 39 minutes of viewing or alerts like you get on the nest app,0,1,Negative
3,22-Jul-18,Black  Spot,would be 5 stars if you could turn off the  things to try  screen    i should have read up on this before buying the spot  amazon  please update to enable us to turn this off  it is so extremely annoying to look over to see the time but instead see  things to try,1,2,Unknown

1,22-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i own 3 of these    amazon is ignoring its customers and using these devices as a marketing tool  you can customize the screen contents  but you cannot turn off there advertising  things to try    people will suggest that you can  but you can only do so if you turn off all content changes which is not an acceptable option moreover  they should increase the size slightly  and improve the audio speaker  that would give you a 5 star device right now i m debating whether to return all 3 devices  my wife says we should,0,1,Negative
5,22-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i never thought i was going to be that person that is completely connected  i purchased this and another echo product on prime day and fell in love  i have one in my office and one in our kitchen  i have already used this for morning briefings from the news while i am getting ready for the day as well as look up recipes  the screen is big enough for me to easily read writing  this was a concern for me   i loved this so much i purchased it for my grandparents and parents so they can easily video call me as they tend to have issues with their computer and other video conferencing tools  note  i did purchase camera covers  even though there is a button to  turn off the camera and microphone  and it does not impede the operations and camera so if that is what you are worried about  there are work around,1,5,Positive

5,21-Jul-18,White  Spot,this is the best alexa enabled device you can get  it is so versatile and useful  it sound way better than the dot but not as good as the regular echo  the screen makes all the difference in the world,1,4,Positive
5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i needed an alarm clock and this fit the bill perfectly  i am a believer in amazon echo  alexa and fire  great customization options and alexa is always helpful  sound quality is also surprisingly good,1,5,Positive
4,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,you are going to have to shell out an extra dollar 20 bucks for the stand that should come with it so you can angle it best for how ever you are using this  my biggest gripe  i already spent an arm and a leg on this it should come with the stand,1,5,Positive
4,21-Jul-18,White  Spot,love it except that amazon needs a reference one cohesive link for a full user manual  i do not have hours to research websites  plus  more instruction from alexa on skills would be great  we often get the answer    i do not know that skill   even though i have added it in the app  i e  kwikset or pizza hut,1,4,Positive

5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,,1,4,Positive
5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i got this on prime day and figured i would see what all the hype is about  honestly i did not really want to like it as personally bugging my house seems kinda weird  but honestly  i love it  like it or not this is the way the world is going  so why not i loved it so much i ordered 2  i did not get the show because it looks like it came from the 1990 s and is downright ugly  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway  so the spot s screen does not bother me   although it is very clear alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it is hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar   where i can just say play any song i want and it will  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that  but you do not know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much   they also do not rotate when playing music  i would love for it to display the weather as i listen to music the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be   there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places  that you program and name  so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents   and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic  i have this programmed for my parents  fiances parents  work  and her work  so it really works great the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications   i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot   the dot lights up colors   why can not the spot   the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring  just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery overall it is a great device that i am looking forward to integrating my home around  i am already looking at dash buttons  smart plugs  etc    and   when i become a home owner instead of renting where i can not tinker with my thermostat i will be purchasing a nest down the road for hvac integration,1,3,Neutral
5,21-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the screen response time is way better than i expected  sound quality is good too  also it s not so bright that i have to turn off the screen but it is an option  i have a dot in another room and which ever hears me better is the one that responds,1,3,Neutral

3,20-Jul-18,White  Spot,i bought this to replace a dot in my bedroom  already have a show and a couple of full sized echo units in my house the spot is okay for what it is  two issues  one minor and one major  the minor one   why include the huge bezel on the front  why not take that space and make the display larger  a total waste of usable space  the major one  also involves the show  i am very used to these devices  i do not need to see  things to try  whenever i use a voice command with it  even setting it to rotate once starts this crap over again when you dare to actually use the devices   i am not a child and i do not need to be told a hundred times how to play music on it  and having this on my nightstand and seeing these highly annoying tips is just outrageous for a unit meant to be used next to a bed  why does not amazon fix this and give us the option to turn this nonsense off  i want to see a clock face  period  not these silly nanny reminders,1,2,Unknown

4,20-Jul-18,White  Spot,loving this way more than google home devices  i have been using for a couple months and if you are an amazon prime subscriber the value here is greater than google  i am using to listen to free music with prime  better than alternatives   audible and you can even watch movies  the display is a little small for lots of watching  the sound should be louder  and youtube needs to be available  these issues put this at a 3 5 to 4 stars  fix one of them  youtube  and its a 5 star item  to alleviate sound i have paired with a blue tooth speaker  right now this sits in my living area  where i think it will shine is my office desk  once there are great offers i could see purchasing additional for nightstand or other amazon alexa items for my household  i felt happy after adding this to my house where as i felt stupid using google home,1,4,Positive

2,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the echo works fine but then you get indundated with  things to try   i am not a 10 year old that needs stimulus to tell me to do things  i found there is no way to turn this off except for      turning off the screen  if i cannot find a suitable fix for this it goes back,0,3,Unknown

4,19-Jul-18,White  Spot,bought this to replace a sony dash  remember those   after sony decided to pull support from it entirely  it works great for what i use it for  an alarm clock  a weather station  background music player and voice control of lights throughout my house  my biggest gripe about the device and why i knocked a star off is that you can not turn off the suggestions on  things to try   it  s an annoying and a stupid design decision since you have control to turn off other things you do not want to see as it cycles through content screens  a software update or two would help this improve especially full control of what we want and do not want to see in the content rotation,1,4,Positive

1,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the product is attractive and somewhat useful  but  amazon chose to force users to view their  things to try  and trending   this greatly depreciates the value of the product  do not buy unless you are willing to view a billboard from amazon,0,2,Negative
5,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,the echo spot has really helped me to streamline my day and be more efficient  it reminds me of any appointments  warns me about traffic snarls  and tells me the weather every day while suggesting new music and introducing me to new artists,1,5,Positive

2,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,it s not as good as siri  but it still has some positives  it is great at playing music  and setting alarms  i personally felt that i paid too much for this product  as it was nearly half off on prime day  literally the day after i purchased it   so i am pretty disappointed  i might still return it and get my money back,0,3,Unknown
4,19-Jul-18,Black  Spot,having received this as a gift  i am writing my initial thoughts   compared to my google home mini pros  way easier to setup than the google home mini  i was able to connect all of my smart home device  unlike google  without any issues  making phone calls on this was clearer for the receiver to understand me cons  need to enable  skills  to get more functionality  google home has built in functionality to search the web for answer to questions easier than the amazon echo  could not connect this to youtube,1,5,Positive

5,18-Jul-18,Black  Spot,thank god  and alarm clock with an lcd that gets dim enough for me to sleep  i am a very light sensitive sleeper and wind up taping black tape over all my other stuff in my bed room  not this guy  the alexa features are nice and listening to music at night is great  we enjoy falling asleep to meditation podcasts though we have to use the skill anypod to get the podcasts we like  video is kinda tiny and useless at this size but that is to be expected  audio quality is much better than echo dot,1,4,Positive
5,18-Jul-18,White  Spot,i love this thing  at first i thought it wouldn t stay on the clock and that i would have to suffer through ads forever but when the lights are off it sits on the clock and it s very comfortable for the eyes  easy set up  love it,1,5,Positive

5,18-Jul-18,Black  Spot,love this thing  people think i m crazy for paying this much for a glorified alarm clock  but i don t care   for me  waking up in a good mood is pretty important and this helps me do it   so glad i don t have to deal with my old eeaanh eeaanh eeaanh alarm  very excited to say  alexa  turn off the lights   smart plugs get here soon   got a camera privacy slide for this since it is in my bedroom,1,5,Positive
5,18-Jul-18,Black  Spot,i absolutely love this  very user friendly and i got the kasa cam to go with it to monitor my living room  super easy to set up and operate  i only wish it actually came with the camera privacy cover and pivoting stand which you can buy separately  i m looking forward to future software updates for different clock faces  i like digital but i miss the colon in between the hours and minutes on most of them  i d also like to see more celebs jump on board for the alarm voices  i really have no complaints  i m being nit picky at this point  worth every penny,1,5,Positive

1,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,bought the spot and loved it  within months it started acting funny and would stop working called and they determined that it was overheating  i was told to unplug and technical support would call within 24 48 hours  waited 48 hours without response and replied to email and was asked to wait a week  a week goes by with absolutely no response so i do the inline chat per instructions  told to wait longer  really     unacceptable expected more from amazon  find it funny how they always thank me for being a prime member but when an issue arises i cannot even get assistance,0,1,Negative
4,17-Jul-18,White  Spot,much easier to use than the dot  it picks up my voice from farther away and the speakers seem a lot cleaner sounding the screen is a nice perk but i only use it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed  the screen is too small to watch shows  it displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly  and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures  my only complaint is that they do not add the stand as standard  i did not need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed many people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i am not going to split hairs  the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot  alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly  now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice  i think amazon is working overtime on this project  i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything i am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i am staying in a hotel and she is no where to be found  alexa  what time is it  alexa,1,4,Positive
5,17-Jul-18,White  Spot,when we were buying another product there was an option to bundle this one for an extra dollar 30   so we thought why not  well  i am so glad we did  we are really enjoying our echo spot  it reads stories to our girls  plays music  gives us the news  and so much more  it is so responsive and has so many skills that we enjoy,1,5,Positive

3,17-Jul-18,Black  Spot,this is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video  much of the time it works well as alarm clock  but there are some serious flaws  particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake  it doesn t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying  alexa set an alarm for 5am  and then having alexa repeat  ok alarm set for 5am   not good  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid  plain and simple  this device needs to be brought into the 1990 s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone  no thanks  if i m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen  so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later  my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i m in the shower,1,4,Positive

3,31-Jul-18,Black  Show,it seems to work well  unfortunately a lot of the functionality is lost because  as many have mentioned  it does not work with google or youtube any more  this problem is caused by google because they came up with their own devices an no longer allow access from other devices like these  this even effected my smart tv  anyhow we purchased a few of these to communicate with our children and grandchildren so we will see what happens when we hand them out,1,3,Neutral

1,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,waste of money over the echo generation 2  you don t really get anything more from a video chat on this device then you would on facetime or skype and it does not cycle through your pictures when you put it on slideshow mode it sticks on the first photo and will not leave it no matter what you do i have even looked online to research articles and cannot find a solution  i have also had problems with this device shutting down and i have not had these problems on any of the other echo devices  price difference is just not worth it,0,1,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,love this thing   best toy i have bought myself in awhile   so far i have a smart plug connected running my ac  and the wifi light bulbs  baseball scores  weather are cool but the music is the best feature,1,5,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,works exactly how you would expect  right out of the box  i love being able to not only hear  but now see  what i need on this device  i loved my regular echo  but the show is just so much better  it works wonderfully for music  especially paired with the amazon music account  and is perfect with my ring doorbell  love it,1,5,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i have only had this a week but so far so good  we are enjoying it,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,love the product idea  super easy to set up   get started  a breeze to do routine tasks  set alarms  timers  add items to shopping to do lists  play music  get news  just about anything it is supposed to do   the sound is good where imhave it sitting  not tinny at all as some have found  there is one thing i hate   it would keep me from recommending it to anyone   you cannot delete from the nice screen the continually running suggestions of what to ask alexa  unless you have her turn off the screen totally which i do when i go to bed  and it is too bad bc it is like a continuously running advertisement or set up guide  not attractive  the echo show was on sale prior to prime day for less than the echo  so i figured i was getting a great deal for my money when trying to decide which device to start out with  because of the ever present script it is not a nice device to look at  i would not buy it again  or recommend   go with the echo  i may still exchange the product,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,very excited to see what it can do,1,2,Unknown
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,this is great for music  video calling  kitchen timers  and probably a bunch more  the only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the ever floating   things to try   on the home screen  this is purely an aesthetic complaint  but hopefully soon amazon allows the option to shut it off,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,i love the idea is the star trek computer at home  the skills are great  but the natural language work is mediocre,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,got this as a gift    so cool  i can view my news  recipes or shopping lists  and much more,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i do love it  was easy to set up so far  but i wish it has a little more in the set up instructions  there is still a whole lot more i would like to be able to do with it and i have no idea if i can or not with it  but i really do like it,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,this is my second one  i have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office it is amazing for a quick look up while i am working  i live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments i will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family  the gift of organization and information at a voice command away,1,5,Positive

1,30-Jul-18,White  Show,do not waste your money  i own an echo gen 1  and echo gen 2 and a dot  they all do a far better job of voice recognition that the echo show  in fact  it is so bad that it is virtually useless  also  the speaker is incredibly bass heavy    so much so that it is hard to understand voices  i have worked to adjust the bass and punch the mids and treble  but it still sounds awful  finally  the screen just does not add much  i can not see if from across the room  it rarely activates in any meaningful way  and when it does not  it is more of a distraction than a help  using facetime is so much more practicalthan using the show   i am surprised amazon did not make this a little more useful than it is  perhaps in the future  but for now  it is a waste of time and money,0,1,Negative
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i love it  it does everything,1,5,Positive
2,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,thought it would be more powerful and have a lot more functionality  not much better than the echo dot  not worth the money,0,2,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i m loving my new echo show  the video screen adds so much more value and potential  movies  tv shows  song lyrics  all extra features that are available with the echo show  oh  it also has a built in camera for taking pics,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,my wife has been using skype for years to talk to her parents daily  with constant technical issues  since her father is 88  it is a lot to ask the man to uninstall reinstall reconfigure skype  but he does  when i saw these on sale  i jumped on them  my wife was resistant to  learn a new technology   but i told her these just work   like the video phones i saw at the new york world s fair in 1964   54 years ago yesterday it set up quickly and worked fine  with no issues  my wife told her co worker today and she went out and bought 3   one for herself and her husband  and one for each set of parents  it just works  like a telephone   imagine that,1,5,Positive

3,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,the echo show is ok  however the constant suggestions about what to ask alexa are sooooo annoying and there is no way to eliminate it  also  i thought i could have the weather for an area displayed continuously  but i have to talk to alexa  which i do not want to do in the middle of the night  had i payed full price it would have been returned  there are other features that are nice  but i may never use them,1,3,Neutral

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i like it,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,unit is working great  but it is a true pia that products today are shipped without user manuals  do manufacturers truly believe that user will magically know the full capabilities of each product purchased  i have no idea of the echo show s capabilities  i have it linked to my hue lights  but have no idea what commands will work  and what wo not  i purchased a fire tv stick along with the show  but have no idea how to maximize the two  just a few examples i even purchased a text that other users have found to be helpful  seems way too basic to me  but better than a kick in the pants,1,3,Neutral
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,it is a fun item to have  has a lot of udefulness  big negative is that it does not use google  or any real search engine  to get answers or find information,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i was pleasantly surprised  it s awesome so far,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,alexa show is amazing  my wife hated that i bought it  thought we did not need it and after a day she fell in love with alexa too lol  it is so convenient for setting timers  listening to music  playing music for the dog while im not home  connecting to bluetooth speakers for parties  playing movies  i love it,1,5,Positive
2,30-Jul-18,White  Show,do not understand all the excitement over these alexa devices or the google ones either  it rarely gets what i say correct  does not control the dish receiver  yes i set it up correctly  using the alexa app on my phone  we got this for 129  which is a good deal  ti is definately not worth the 229 price though  maybe in another month it will get better  or either i have one that is just deaf and dumb  really can not recommend this item at the current time,0,1,Negative

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,my difficulty is i dont have a cell phone and now you cant download the alexa app on a mac book air  so i am stuck  unable to program my echo show properly  in my opinion you should be able to tell the echo show what you need done  and the echo show does it  every time i ask for something i am referred back to the alexa app on your mobile device  which i cannot access to me this is not intelagence but dependence on other equipment to function every thing today is pushed to the phone  because the phone has been made accessable  to all those who wish to gather information,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,great in the kitchen  i love to cook and it is fun to look up recipes  also great for listening to music and watching shows on amazon prime video while i cook  i subsequently bought an echo dot with the ihome clock docking station for the bedroom  i created a group so i can play music on both of them at the same time  i plan to add more speakers in the future,1,5,Positive

1,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i have been through 4 shows now  and all of them have been broken  it has been anything from screens that lose lines of resolution to timers and reminders going off an hour late or reminders that trigger when trying to set other reminders  i do not have these issues on my dot or my echo  just on the show  it would be nice if amazon could get there act together and actually fix this thing,0,1,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,upgraded from an original echo on prime day and so far i love it  i am sure i have a long way to go to maximize its utility  but for now i owe my marked increase in lyrical knowledge to this thing  who knew post malone actually used words,1,5,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,White  Show,i love the echo show  i m going off to live on campus for school in the fall and we got two of these to serve as an easy way to connect  some people might not like the camera but that makes little sense  we carry devices with cameras all the time  the only difference here is that the item is stationary  my family and i also find the drop in feature a comfort rather than an invasion of privacy  it s definitely a source of relief to my parents that they can so easily pop in onme and visa versa i d also like to thank amazon for including their voiceview screen reader on the device  the show would be a lot less blind friendly  even with alexa present  if they hadn t included that we are an echo loving household with two dots  three echos  and now two shows  i wouldn t be surprised if we got more in the future for ourselves or loved ones  thanks  amazon,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,great addition to the alexa family  just wish it could use the screen more than backgrounds  do not get me wrong i do not regret buying it especially for the primeday sale of dollar 100 off sale price but for now the skills for the show are lacking,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i have had previous experience with the echo dot and this just blows all previous expectations out of the water it s great since it can play videos and music from multiple sources and the speakers are pretty loud,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,White  Show,i basically use it to play music and tell me the news  its sometimes hard to communicate with it  if i dont say the command correctly  but i realize its learning my style of speaking and will do some commands even though i dont say them exactly as i should,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i love the echo show   i have the dot and have been using that for the last 6 months  but the show is so much better  the sound quality is amazing and the screen resolution is like watching a mini 4k tv  i love being able to see my timers  events and list instead of having them read to me  i purchased this on prime day  and it is worth every penny  when the dot was given to me  i thought   this is a cute novelty  but i will probably never use it    was i wrong   echo is part of my daily routine  and has made my life so much easier,1,5,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,so far i m very pleased with my echo show  the problem is  there s so much it can do that i haven t been able to explore the extent of its abilities  i got the special price as part of the prime day promotion   and you just can t beat what you get for the price  very pleased with the sound  the video screen is sharp  sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a command   but as i get to know the system better  i m hoping that will improve  one drawback in the music   i ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past  are re recordings by the original artist   but not the original recording itself  example  secret agent man by johnny rivers   a  live version is used  not the original version  if i m going to pay for prime music   i d like to hear the original version of songs   not later recordings  or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear  otherwise  i am very pleased with my echo show  so pleased in fact  that i bought a second one,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Show,i like everything  about this   im still learning how to use it,1,5,Positive
2,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,it s like having another kid in the house  i have to constantly repeat myself i can tell alexa to do something clear as day  and according to the history  she hears something comeletely different the device is really cool  and i like the concept  which is why it gets two stars  however  it just does not work as intended i find myself irritated more often than not when i use this device,0,2,Negative

4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,it does everything the echo does  and more  although i have not and probably will not use the video functions  i had hoped that the display would be allow for more customization  it does not and is very limited  i would like the clock and weather to display in large text all of the time  it only displays in very small text  it also always has a line that says  tell alexa to do this  or that   tips at the bottom of the screen  i would like to see that go away  but it wo not  sound quality is good  not as good as the big echo  but good enough  i bought it on sale and think i got value for what i paid  i would have been disappointment had i of paid full price,1,3,Neutral

2,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,all of my echo devices stopped communicating properly with sonos devices upon connecting the echo show to my account  asking any echo device to play music on sonos baffled the system that had previously worked flawlessly  this went on for two weeks until i eventually solved the problem that neither amazon nor sonos could figure out,0,1,Negative
5,29-Jul-18,White  Show,so far  i like it  it is better than i expecting it,1,4,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,does not always respond to the wake word  this is my 3rd echo product and i have to say i am a little disappointed  alexa voice assistant is great when it comes to controlling a connected home but has a lot to learn from google assistant when it comes to getting answers for search queries,1,3,Neutral
4,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,good product,1,4,Positive
3,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,after two weeks i am not sure if i like the ever present alexa to have a screen as well  i bought it to be a abay monitor combined with a wifi camera  and that works  but the screen is always on unless you tell it to turn it off   instead of just a talking cylinder you now have a mini screen that not only talks to you but also writes out everything it says or shows accompanying video  there is something about only audio that made alexa different  no i some ways it is a tv that you can talk to,1,2,Unknown

1,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,returned from repair with no repair done  it has a problem which requires it to be on for a while for the defective part to show itself i sent it for repair and got it back without being fixed  the site gives no option to complain from the page i have a echo spot which works perfectly in the same position,0,1,Negative

5,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,i have not had my show very long or used it a lot  but i love it  i use it to set timers when cooking because my stove is being finicky and not wanting to work most of the time  i also use it to check for different recipes  listen to music and my all time favorite     telling everyone it is time for dinner  my son gets a real kick out of that i know a lot of people are expecting more out of their shows then it is possible to at the moment  but remember the original echo did not have what it has now when it first came out  i see that amazon is adding new stuff all the time and soon i am sure it will have all that we want very soon     maybe even things we have not thought of i do wish it was a bit more user friendly  i still have not figured out how to video chat with my cousin in north carolina who also has one  and when i tried to call my son s dot it went to video chat immediately  last i looked  dots do not have video screens another thing that needs to be addressed is when my husband tried to have the one in our bedroom play thunderstorm sounds to help him go to sleep  it tried to get him to buy an app instead of playing the skill i had enabled that was free  so now he is a bit worried to use it again  that needs to be fixed i do have to say that all in all i am very happy with my echo show,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,White  Show,i have not had it very long  it is my first alexa thing  i sure like what i have done with it so far there is a lot to learn and play with,1,4,Positive

1,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,great device  features are awesome  the interaction is fantastic  home automation works perfect if you link up your accounts correctly  my only issue is out of  4  echo shows  2  of them have been sent off for repair because of the screen glitching   these are less than 3 months old and already having issues first repairs were sent off and they  updated the firmware  when i got the device back nothing worked  i had to update to the newest firmware for it to work again  then  2  weeks later the glitch starts up again i love the show but i m getting really frustrated with the glitching,0,2,Negative

1,29-Jul-18,Black  Show,i bought this product hoping that alexa would be pretty well developed and far enough along  therefore expecting her to be responsive  this dollar 100 piece of crap doesnt even know how to respond to a question that amazon themselves told me to ask her   echo buttons manual  see step 3   the device has potential given it has a big screen  decent sound but for 200 bucks  i would never reccomend it  even for the dollar 100 i spent  i feel like i got shorted  oh and lastly  the device is pretty useless without a prime membership  i linked my personal account to it and the thing was literally a decorated bluetooth speaker  i went on the family account  this one  and got it to work minimal  oh  and even with our prime membership  you have to have a music pass or something that is an extra 3 99 a month  leaving this item a subscription nightmare  and a overpriced  decorated bluetooth speaker in my eyes  i would give it zero stars if i could,0,1,Negative

1,29-Jul-18,White  Show,our family bought several of these to help communicate with older parents and grandparents who need simpler devices than a full fledged tablet  what fantastic potential these have   for digital photo screen  video calls  easy accesss to music  audio books  etc  however  once we have them setup  we discovered the huge lurking negative  amazon forces you to view continous spam on the home screen promoting all their alexa features  you can turn off many other things in settins  but you cannot turn off  things to try   instead of a beautiful digital photo screen with weather and time     we now constantly have a spam ad across the home screen that says   try          amazon  please listen to your customers and offer a setting to turn off this spam,0,3,Unknown

3,29-Jul-18,White  Show,the ability to respond with the accuracy and variety of information provided by google search has spoiled me i had originally expected to see that the same type of search engine in the echo not so  the ability of alexa to provide such detailed information is not part of the package perhaps improvements are in the offing with further updates,1,3,Neutral

2,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,this was my 4th echo device  1st echo show it seemed to have huge potential  and i really wanted to like it  but soon found out it is quite limited  a bit disappointing  but not the end of the world  i used it like i use my other  screenless echos     for a little under 2 month  when the screen started flickering  mostly on the bottom of the screen but not just  a quick look in some forums made me understand it is pointless asking for a replacement  as some people had 2 3 devices replaced  only to start flickering again shortly after  amazon are not providing any serious answers  and this has been going on for quite some time apparently long story short  i moved it to the hallway  and been using it as a very expensive    and bulky voice activated light switch for my hue lights  so like the headline suggests    meh,0,3,Unknown
4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,love it to play music works great for finding recipes  need more family to have adapted machines to see,1,5,Positive
4,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,it seems a little less intuitive then the regular echo plus  it is also a little harder for it to pick up what you are saying  when combined with the other four we have in the household  having to speak loud enough for it to hear was cross activating other ones  so we had to rename this one  overall it works well  but does not seem as adept at doing things as the original echo plus,1,3,Neutral
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Show,this is my second show  i like them very much  i use mine for music and my arlo security cameras  i can connect and display my outdoor cameras by voice  they are exceptionally capable devices  i highly recommend them,1,5,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,was surprised to learn this can be used as a bluetooth speaker for phones and tablets    it probably lists it in the description  but i missed that part  it not quite the surround like quality of a bluetooth speaker in the dollar 100  range  but its very good none the less  and with even basic access to amazon music there is a lot to listen to  there is a huge number of things alexa can do  learning more every day,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,using as a hub and music,1,5,Positive
3,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,still need more ai built into it to interact better  it needs to continue the conversation sometimes if the finding   answer needs to be right  you can not keep stop alexa and ask again and again  also  it should be able to access the wikipedia  dictionary in many areas with better and fast access needs to hear us better  also  we should be able to name it on our own instead calling alexa or echo  price can be reduced a bit  value based  and updates should be auto and daily to improve it  connectivity to other home equipment can be imrproved as well good product with good sound quality  but needs more ai built in,1,3,Neutral
5,30-Jul-18,White  Plus,it was an excellent purchase  echo plus has sound quality  good size  i love it    i it,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,awesome product  very responsive alexa just needs more content and variety when it comes to music  it uses the bing search engine instead of google  if only the two could combine  it would be a perfect product,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i am pleasantly surprised at the accuracy of alexa  the unit is very responsive and can easily respond even with tv or music playing i did pair two smart bulbs and they go on  off and dim with ease using voice or app  fidelity is very good for the size my only regret is that i would have liked a silver model or a fabric cover but that is an unimportant issue,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,we went to a best buy with the intention of buying alexa products  instead were talked into the google home products  bought the google home and the home mini    has trouble from the start setting them up  and they couldn t understand my husband  scottish accent   after days of the  oops  something went wrong  command   we returned them and bought the amazon echo show and the echo plus    so easy to set up  it connected immediately to my amazon account and was way easier to navigate  they both understand commands from my husband on the first try and have yet to give an error message  we have loved these two products and should have gone with what we intended in the first place  you won t regret your purchase,1,1,Unknown
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,tons of features and skills  and a very good speaker with plenty of bass for music  you still need some work on the ai  in responding to random questions though  my android phone is far better at those    with the echo i still get a lot of  hmm  i am not sure  or  i do not have an opinion on that,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i like alexa,1,4,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,so far it has been fun to use and learn how to deal with alexa  i am still learning and finding out what can really be done  plus i am in the process of making my house a smart house  so there is no much to control with alexa yet,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i like the whole thing so far,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,same specs as regular echo  but easier to use than getting a separate hub for smart lights  etc,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,it s a great product with many good aspects  it easy to setup and control with intuitive straight forward instructions  the included lightbulb was excellent and worked perfectly  i very much enjoy this product and recommend it,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,not that much different than the one we had  alexa is still stubborn  lol  we ordered it on the prime day to get the light bulbs with it i the deal but did not get the light bulbs  when we called she said they were sold out  felt bad about that  now we have to buy light bulbs,1,2,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,to have ability to play amazon music outside for patio gatherings  i also used blue tooth to connect echo plus via alexa app on my tablet to an external speaker when if the party extends into the yard  i have plans to connect other devices such as thermostat and other lighting and home devices,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,we got this mainly for our son who is currently vision impaired   it has many good things and setup was fairly easy once i did the first one but they should be easier to setup and come loaded with more stuff   it should do text messages to friends easier without them having to download something for it to work and it should link with email and also them common social media like facebook and twitter and others  the whole purpose was to get him back connected to the web by voice so he would not feel left out and isolated   they should also have a tech support phone number to call or a way to do direct help to the echo so tech support can help setup the device   i had to get a friend whos an it guy to come help me setup,1,4,Positive
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i love every aspect of the echo plus  i wanted it for my office  the light was also for my desk lamp,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,great hub,1,5,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,this is very hard to review because i am part of the problem i am 75 and got it so my dog would have distracting noise when i am not home i am computer literate  itunes literate  amazon literate  as well as countless other programs  but am apparently a dunce when it comes to talking to alexa  i think i heard her sigh in exasperation i tried to create a playlist of songs i like only to have it ignored  i am learning workarounds but they are mediocre  at best   and  as yet do not include a personal playlist i have scoured the beginners section but the beginners it addresses are far more advanced in basic alexa than am i so far  i like what i have been able to use but i would like it a lot more if i could configure it to my needs  rather than accepting the amazon alexa default karen,1,2,Unknown
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,very satisfied with the purchase  the package came in good time and was just as expected,1,5,Positive

5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,not perfect but very good  a few times alexa picked up something from tv  and has a very slight problem with smart home equipment in that she gets confused with what we want to call things  if you call something  light  in the app you need to say light  not  lights   echo plus has no problems as a smart hub but i could use better user directions  well worth owning and a good step to making my home smart,1,4,Positive
4,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,pretty cool  i have only begun to figure out things she does,1,4,Positive

5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i love my echo plus  i have not one bad thing to say  it controller music when i need it too  with a great sounding 360 speaker  i also bought a 4k fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment  the included hue lighting makes this product even better  i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room  the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer  alexa will controll it all as soon as you say   hey alexa    and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device  this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,amazon music is great  love the ability to create my only playlists  has great sound  not up to the standard of our bose but very good,1,5,Positive

5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,its work perfect an i must introduce the rest of the device to complete the functions,1,5,Positive
2,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i decided to buy smart door lock and decided on getting the echo plus to control it  i chose a kwikset 888 because amazon said it was compatible and i bought 2 dots while i was at it  and when i posed the question  somebody in the community said it will work with alexa  what i did not know was the z wave lock and zigbee alexa hub were not compatible  does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus  if not  i guess my choices are  1  exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink  2  return the whole alexa system and get something else i do not want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i will be back here asking how to integrate two hubs the reason i kept from buying smart systems up to this point is because i was afraid they would not operate seamlessly and unfortunately i only do enough research after something does not work,0,3,Unknown
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,this echo plus has proved to be the most innovative improvement in my life,1,5,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,White  Plus,i purchased the amazon echo plus on amazon prime day because i need a hub  i am in the process of upgrading my home into a smart home  for the same price as some hub s  and even less expensive in some other cases  i got a hub that works with my devices  plus it does a lot more  i have not even had time to go through all the skills it has  but i have already found myself using many of them  when i started a search for a hub  i was not even considering the echo  in part  because i did not know it was a hub  but also because i did not really think i would find much use for another ai system  if you are looking for a hub  why settle for a plane hub  when you can get a personal assistant that does so much more and yet cost s the same or less than other hubs  oh  and by the way  for the same price as the amazon echo plus alone  i found one that came bundled with a smart bulb   saw another that came with a smart plug  given the price of these extras  well  that just put the echo plus over the top,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i m so happy that i purchased alexa  when i recently saw this at a friend s home  he played some music while talking about the product  i love the sound   love that all i have to do is tell alexa or ask a question   she responds immediately  i have not been able to listen to my cd s for a while since i have a problem within my stereo equipment for some time now so this makes me extremely happy that it is not an issue any longer,1,5,Positive

4,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i love everything about it  i love that the echo plus turns on and off my light  it can also dim them with voice commands  i also like listening to my kindle books even the ones that i didn t purchased audibles for  i like that it can play my music from amazon music  pandora  tunein  i heart radio and spotify  echo can even play my local radio station  i love that the echo is connected to my tivo bolt  this allows tivo to pause  stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command  i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed  when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered  the only three dislikes that i have is that if you re up too close or to far the echo doesn t respond  so i think they need to improve the microphone  and i wish the speaker was better  the speakers are okay but could be improved  also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet  well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus  this error was sorry i m having trouble understanding you please try again later  after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my internet  and it was easy to find this out  and i found it odd that my dot wasn t having this problem even though they are connected to the same network,1,5,Positive

5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,alread had echos and dots  but the ability to control philips hue bulbs nudged me to buy this on prime day  another fun product from amazon,1,4,Positive
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i purchased the echo plus with the build in hub  so i could have the convenience of asking alexa to turn my lights and lamps on and off  philips hue light bulbs were placed in the fixtures that i wanted alexa to control and they all work great  i already had an echo dot in my kitchen den area  so i placed the echo plus with hub in my bedroom  my radio and lamps in my kitchen and den are controlled with tp link plugs  but  the ceiling light fixtures and lamp in my den and bedroom have special philips hue light bulbs that are controlled by the hub inside the echo plus  i am able to play music  set my alarm  get weather reports and numerous other things on both devices  the echo dot requires a tp link plug to be plugged into it and the echo plus requires a special philips light bulbs installed in each light fixture to work   the only thing i dislike is the high price of the light bulbs required to make the lights work  regular light bulbs placed in the ceiling light fixtures will not work with alexa and the echo plus with hub  other than the high price of the bulbs  i love my echo plus with built in hub,1,5,Positive

3,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i like the list ability and the music i can play  i do not like that i can not create a playlist without using the app and even then alexa will not play my songs i have to do it through my tablet or phone  i also do not like that alex can not print again it has to be done through the app,1,3,Neutral
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,it is a great bundle of fun  music  games  questions etc  i luv it turns off my smart lights  i purchase 4 more smart light for my lamps in the living room and my room,1,5,Positive

5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,really cool device that does a ton of stuff  fun games like jeopardy  we used this to set up smart bulbs and light switches  make sure you ge the stuff that corresponds with this particular hub  had to make a few runs back to the store for exchanges,1,5,Positive

5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i have not had it very long  but so far our whole family is enjoying asking alexa questions,1,4,Positive
3,28-Jul-18,White  Plus,although this is my second echo device  i am still very disappointed that there is almost no documentation instructions as to the many functions of the device  i purchased becausse of the sound quality  but only found out it has bluetooth capabilities last night by accident  there needs to be a manual that details all of the functionality of the device  or at least point out where it can be found,1,2,Unknown
5,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the echoplus is a great extension for the echo dots in our home  i am a little disappointed that alexa is not as good at information requests as google  but as a start on home automation  she is very impressive,1,4,Positive
4,28-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i never had alexa before but the biggest reason i bought it was for youtube and apparently youtube stopped supporting it and that is why it will get 4 stars     it is mostly youtube s fault but i worked around it by using my cell phone as a blue tooth connected to hear things but still takes the voice activate purpose away but the speaker is amazing to hear my youtube watch later playlist,1,4,Positive

4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,like it but it will take time to setup all the skills i want simply because there are so many  i already use music and flash briefing daily  very satisfied  i use this along with alexa app on my kindle hd8,1,4,Positive
4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,wish it would have came with the lightbulb  but otherwise works great  fast delivery  and i enjoy using it,1,4,Positive

3,27-Jul-18,White  Plus,sounds well and we find it useful overall but it can be frustrating when it doesn t respond or you forget the correct command   alexa  turn on the living room lights   oops i mean  alexa turn on the family room lights   i also never realized i call my couch a sofa some times  unfortunately my alexa is confused by my changing names for where i sit,1,3,Neutral
1,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,no it is broke and i can not get help fixing or replacing it,0,1,Negative
2,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i m still unable to connect any devices although it says it has a built in hub  so bought a bridge to connect the devices thinking that everything would sync and my other devices are still not discovered via my echo plus and i was looking forward to this feature  being able to play music  check the weather etc is fine,0,3,Unknown
5,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,sounds great have not used the hub yet,1,5,Positive
4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,is as expected and more  responds very fast to given commands and was very easy to connect via the amazon app  i also bought the philipshue light bulb and all i had to do was put it in my lamp and tell alexa to find my device and it connected and the lamp now turns on and off with voice commands,1,5,Positive
4,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,sound is better,1,3,Neutral
5,27-Jul-18,White  Plus,it is as if we are having a conversation with another person  instantaneous response  and the fact that it catches your command even when you are far from it is simply just amazing,1,5,Positive
3,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,although i have not taken advantage of many of the echo s features there is one that bothers me  it starts talking even when i have not said anything even close to the wake up word   echo   had to change from alexa due to a conflict with another device,1,3,Neutral
5,27-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the echo plus is very straight forward and easy to use  it plays great sounding music and can do lots of other things  still learning what all it can do  working very well so far,1,5,Positive

5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,like it  still working discovery  really too soon to fully evaluate  but looking forward to learning and using it,1,4,Positive
2,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,when i got this echo i was excited to have a device with better sound than my dot and a hub to control some hue bulbs what i did not realize and also was not fully communicated to me  is that you can not use hue bulbs to their full potential with this device  you can only turn on and off the lights and set them to a number of preset colors  you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices  if you do  you will end up needing to update to a standalone hub  which makes the hub inside this device redundant and pointless i still love the echo and have zero complaints about the alexa functionality or sound quality of this device  i am only disappointed with the hub s functionalities,0,2,Negative
4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,still needs some work on commands  sound is equal in the regular echo so if you do not need a smart hub get a regular echo  the sound is ok with it had as much bass as my old soundlink but i mean hey gets loud on the treble and sounds clear,1,3,Neutral
5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,i love my echo plus  i use it with my spotify account  to find my phone  make phone calls  turn our lights off and on  much more  most importantly it reads story to my children  they love it and that makes me happy,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,excellent why didn t i think it is in the beginning i love it,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,bye bye philips hub and expensive monthly internet charge  took a little tinkering  had to rest the individual bulbs  but works great  no more   philips hue bridge is not responding  message,1,3,Neutral
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,works great  exactly as described  only complaint i have is sometimes alexa gets confused with smart home product names and i had to go back and change some stuff around  but i chalk that up to my inexperience with smart home stuff,1,4,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,i love it  use it mostly for the music huge repertoire to choose from,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,very easy to hook up  download the app and it walks you through the setup,1,5,Positive
1,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i am so disappointed in this product  i tried to install two different units and neither one of them were successfully completed  hours with amazon technicians   resetting each of them  the app did not connect the echo plus to the internet connection  tried using the application on a phone  a tablet and on a chromebook    no luck  there are no clean directions on the application  probably sending this back to amazon  mark this as not ready for prime time,0,1,Negative

3,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,mic hears everything but only understands about half the first time  it often takes multiple tries until it gives the correct result,1,3,Neutral
4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,nice add on to a home what i do not like are the limitations  for example world soccer  it will not give you much info of sport teams other than american,1,4,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i was a little apprehensive about buying this because i saw reviews saying it sounds like crap  i am no audiophile by any means so maybe it is that  but i think it sounds great considering the size  it fills my living room with sound and gets pretty loud while remaining clear  i have not had any issues pairing with my devices or utilizing any of the voice commands  i have it paired to an ecobee3  my firestick  and a phillip s hue light bulb  i plan on adding devices as i go  i love this thing and i am glad i scooped it up  i have only had it around 2 weeks  will update if i run into issues,1,5,Positive
4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i love my echo plus  the only drawback is that there is no battery so it has to be plugged in at all times which makes it inconvenient to use outdoors,1,4,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,great device  my grandkids had a ball setting it up for me,1,5,Positive
1,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,the alexa is awesome but when i rcieved the light buld i did not know that u need another adapter to have the light buld to work  i was not aware of that  disappointed,0,3,Unknown
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the echo plus is great  so easy to set up and with the built in hub  it connects to other alexa devices with a mere verbal command  i am 62 and not super techno knowledgable but this was easy for me  have my lights integrated with alexa and now looking at security cameras and locks  definitely recommend the echo plus,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,works as advertised  it says alexa is always learning  that is great because i am just learning all the things alexa can do,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,great   love it,1,5,Positive
2,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,wish it had a battery or was described better as a plug in only item,0,3,Unknown

4,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,connecting and sound are perfect  i only give 4 because the is no internal battery  if i disconnect to the power source  it will be off,1,4,Positive
4,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,it seems easy to stump alexa with rather simple questions that are easily googled with the correct answer  we admit that we have not explored all that is available through the echo  one irritating issue is that alexa cannot answer help questions concerning how to use the system  rather it refers you to the alexa app or help via a computer  it was very simple to setup and use and we continue to learn how this tool can become more useful,1,3,Neutral
4,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i like how easy it was to set up  very easy to use and set up with other bluetooth devices,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,ease of use and many tasks it will perform,1,5,Positive
5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,i purchased the echo plus with built in hub during prime days sale  it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi  also connected it to a smart plug to control a light  i love telling alexa to play music  and she hears me from 2 rooms away  excited to learn new uses for it,1,5,Positive
2,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,it was harder to setup then i thought it should be  for some reason i had to default it twice  had to go thru too many steps to setup and find my devices  would be nice if it could interact with my xfinity cable tv cable box and it also does not work with my xfinity alarm for my house or my cameras  be nice set and disarm the alarm with alexa  had to install a skill app to setup bulb     whats that about  you ship it with your product     should have said  alexa setup bulb  or  alexa find new bulb      and  alexa setup nest     it is fine that you use third party apps but alexa should do the work for you,0,2,Negative
5,26-Jul-18,White  Plus,nothing to dislike i love my new toy that has made my house a smart home,1,5,Positive
3,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the built in hub lacks some of the features  geo fencing  of the phillips hub  otherwise would have given it 5 stars,1,3,Neutral

1,26-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the echo part works fine  the hue hub is a disaster  it worked for a few months and then nothing  i spent 2 hours on the phone with tech support one  y to have to send it in for repair  i am now trying to reconnect my lights  what a pain  i am having to reset each light bulb  it can take up to 5 times to get it to reset  i have spent hours on this  i will say customer service was friendly and tried to be helpful  stick with the echo and smart plugs for lamps,0,2,Negative

5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,this is the 3rd unit i purchased all the way from gen 1 to the plus  the only reason i purchased this is because it works so well and i wanted it in other rooms as well  all my switches work great and i have had not issues  i the past  i did have some ghost commands when alexa would answer a question when no one asked her to but i think some recent ipdates may have resolved this  it just keeps improving over time  not with call capabilities  i work with adapting smart homes and this is by far the cheapest  best way so far  can t wait to see what they come up with next,1,5,Positive

5,25-Jul-18,Black  Plus,this is a very useful device  i use it to turn my lights on and off around the house  it works with all the other alexa devices  so i can give a command near any of them  and this will process the request  it also handles all the functions that the other devices can do  i enjoy it much more than i thought i would,1,5,Positive

5,25-Jul-18,White  Plus,i have been hesitant to purchase anything smart home because i am just not good with electronics  however this surprised me how easy it is to set up and it links to the bluetooth in my sound bar for my tv which provides extra sound for music  i can make calls and finally hear people when home  i do not have cable  only the paid apps like netflix and hulu so when alexa provided me news stations  weather and other updates it was really great to hear  i have linked all of my accounts to her  she turns on my lights before i walk through the door  she purchases re orders off of amazon for my pets and i heard if something bad happened at your home she would place a call to 911 regardless if she was unplugged or not  this is important as an extra layer of protection for someone living alone  my tech savvy bf went out and bought her after a week of me having her  must buy,1,5,Positive

1,24-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i will be returning it  it is been nothing but annoying  the hub can not be turned off if not needed and it interferes with my hue bridge  i can not even install philips lights with it unless i unplug it to do so  there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth with the issues  bottom line is it sucks as a hub  it does not support z wave and zigbee  which in fairness i knew in advance   but when the one protocol it does support does not do many functions that a dedicated one will  what is the point  i noticed right away that my philips hue bridge supports firmware upgrades to the light bulbs themselves and this does not  i found that rather interesting,0,2,Negative

5,23-Jul-18,White  Plus,works great i bought this direct from amazon  and i have got to tell you  this item echo show and echo plus is the best item i have ever had and i am kind of a tech geek  i am a disabled person  and it helps me turn light on and off  and schedule doctor appointments  using google voice phone  and get my medical rides to and from hospitals  plays music on cue from multiple web apps  and watch videos  as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events  i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights  they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them  although the echo show is not a hub once you set up the echo plus hub with your lights you can use any amazon device to shut the lights off  thank god  no more working my ass off to turn on or off lights  thank you amazon  i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house  jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your allowing me to get amazon prime at a lower cost due to disability i was finally able to buy these items on your prime day event  really helped when all you earn a month is dollar 672 on ssdi thank you all again,1,5,Positive
2,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i m sure the echo is as cool as everyone says    but i will not get to try this one  even though i have a large covered porch     the package was left on my top step on a day forecast for 100 percent chance of rain     and rain it did  soaking the package  i am not even going to open it and see how bad the damage is  this order has been cursed from the beginning  ordered as a birthday gift and delivery was not made on scheduled day  now i get it  and its rain soaked,0,1,Negative
5,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,so far i love it  it was easy to set up   if i can do it anybody can  speakers are great and its fun to play my music with just a voice command,1,5,Positive

3,23-Jul-18,Black  Plus,we are a long time amazon prime family  many years  but new to the alexa world and thought the purchase of alexa plus  with hub  and included phillips hue light bulb would be a great start  alexa does a lot of good things for us like alarm in the morning  verbalize books  playing music on command  even linked to my sirrius xm account  good daily stuff  good sound  but not bose  but  the ads say  hub included  so do not need anything else to operate devices  well  not so  i understand there will be some differences in product device support  the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on  off  dimming of the bulb  the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge  so  it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes  time the lights when you are away  set color tones  etc  that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home  the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own bridge  was very disappointed to find that out after the fact  to the point i feel we are being misled by amazon by included the hue bulbs without explanation  maybe throw a good discount my way to get the hue bridge if i keep the echo plus before i invest in more light bulbs,1,3,Neutral

4,22-Jul-18,White  Plus,i bought 2 of these  plus 2 echo dot 2nd generation  on prime days  love the echo plus easy to setup  the reason for the 4 star is the fact that one of them did not arrive with the free philips hue white a19 single led bulb works with amazon alexa  there is no one to call to find out why,1,4,Positive
1,22-Jul-18,Black  Plus,product does not  light bar never went orange  i googled it and reset instructions actually differ from package instructions  i tried both  product is defective,0,1,Negative

5,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i have an original echo and really like it  i wanted another one for my basement  i realize it is not a huge stereo with settings but it does not sound bad at all  definitely does not take up much room  great price for the echo plus on prime day  i ordered two,1,4,Positive
5,21-Jul-18,White  Plus,i bought this on prime day and saved lots i have 3 large blue tooth speakers in my house that i used for years  the echo plus was louder than all 3 combined at the same time  very impressed with the clarity and volume you will need a paid subscription to some form of steaming audio  that s just a sad fact  it ll play pandora and spotify but it s limited in skips and song selection without a subscriptiondoes not stream youtube music or youtube audioapple users will be disappointed to see that it s not as convenient as an apple deviceoverall  i still loved the device but i ll be getting the dot which has an audio out jack  as does the echo plus  and just connect to external speakers,1,4,Positive
2,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i have been thinking about getting this for a long time and was excited when it arrived bundled with a philip hue bulb  the excited ended quickly  i spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus  everything i tried  ended in a discovery failed message  i tried to set this up over and over and over again  i watched youtube videos  i read set up websites  i was the poster child of insanity  doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results  the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work  but also the problem not being operator error  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr  and 19 mins  of being on the phone  it still did not work  this product has tested my patience  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb  the problem was not the bulb  because before packing up the items  i purchased another bulb and still alexa could not locate this device i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating  but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo  the support person had the same thought  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can not get over the look of that hub  it looks like a defuser i can not believe i did not find youtube videos that show the problems i did  everything looked simple and seamless   not the experience i had  ok  i am done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already,0,1,Negative

5,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i m an original purchaser of the echo when they came out with a limited few in their test phase and i have always loved it  i expanded my alexa usage by adding a few echo dots around the house and finally decided to jump and buy an echo plus  let me tell you what  great choice  as much as i love my original echo  the plus was an obvious upgrade immediately noticeable  the sound is great  and the fact that it is got a built in hub for the philips hue lights is a huge plus,1,5,Positive
1,21-Jul-18,Black  Plus,received the wrong product   was so excited to install it    all excitement gone  thank you amazon,0,1,Negative

5,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,sounds a little better than the original plus it now has an interrogated zigbee hub  the hub is compatible with the ge link bulbs,1,4,Positive
4,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i got it to try side by side with the echo originale  they are essentially the same in dimension  weight and the woofer is the same save for the smaller tweeter point up instead of down and the built in hub  as many folks already pointed out  the hub is not a direct replacement for the philips hue  z wave or anything else  it provides a sub set of features available from the stand alone hub and you ended up losing functionality that you took for granted on the dedicated hub  for me  the voice recognition and music play capability is the same  the original echo may have an edge on the volume department due to larger speakers  the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i do not really need the hub with less functionality  in addition  i do not think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed  my philips hub gets software update probably once every couple months and it keeps up with the changes in the new bulbs fw and they fixes bugs  net net for me  this echo does not do anything more than the original echo and sound quality is not as good  with the original echo available as refurbished i would check that out first before considering this or the new echo which is clearly inferior to both of these,1,3,Neutral
2,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,why do we need to buy a dollar 100 hub to get it to work with samsung tv s and many other devices  i want my money back  this thing will not even turn on my tv unless i buy another hub  what is the point of having a hub that does not support half the devices out there  do not buy this thing unless you want to spend another dollar 100 on another hub  it will not work with many of your devices  just by the echo or dot if you must but not this  better yet  get a google device  they actually understand you when you talk,0,1,Negative
5,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,i love it  in my living room,1,5,Positive
5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,absolutely love it   only thing that would make it better is if was rechargeable  when playing music with bluetooth speaker outside i have to go inside to change songs,1,5,Positive
1,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i only purchase the echo plus because it has a built in hub and came with the free philips hue bulb  when i got everything set up  i realized the echo plus hub won t allow full functionality of the bulb  all it does is turn the light on off and dim  it will not change colors  you still have to have a hue bridge to have full function of all the features of the bulb  i wish i d bought the bulb and bridge separately to use with the echo i already had since the built in hub on this echo will essentially be useless and i ll have to buy the hue bridge to get the full benefit of the lights,0,2,Negative
2,20-Jul-18,White  Plus,at a volume setting of half or less  the speaker sounds like there is something rattling  crackling or vibrating in it  i would understand if the volume was set higher  all speakers get distorted when over driven  but this does not sound like this is an over driven case  sounds like more of a rattle crackle  possibly because the bass is too high  learned that there is no ability to adjust any of the sound characteristics  other than volume   i will attempt to exchange it assuming it is just an isolated problem,0,2,Negative
5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,the sound is fantastic for the classic music  is like you have the orchestra at your home  and you can control the sound with out screamig at it you just have to twist the top  but also you can tell  alexa volume 3,1,5,Positive

3,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i was suppose to get the  free  lightbulb with purchase  it did not come with echo  upon reading more carefully  it says to click a box to receive free bulb    of course i want the free bulb  who wouldn t  just a sneaky way for them to get out of having to give so many   free  bulbs away  disappointed  i have yet to set up my echo  our first purchase on any alexia device  debating if we want to keep it  it did come quickly with my prime membership,1,2,Unknown
1,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i bought this for myself and i didn t realize it had to be plugged in just to work  it isn t convenient to make them always have to connect to a wall  it should ve been more clear when i bought it,0,2,Negative

5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,alexa helps with more than just lights or music  it helps out when your kids think they know everything and you know nothing lol sweet love it so much so i purchased 2  alexa has been a great purchase for my uncle whom lives by himself  when i got it he wasnt so keen on it  but now its his best friend  he tells her goodmorning and she will say it back along with a description on something that is happening today or something special that happened years ago on that day  as well as sang him happy birthday lolol he now has educated him self on things he never knew  and laughs at the things she may say when he waits to see he response to something hes asked love it  and to think i was going to hate it,1,5,Positive
5,20-Jul-18,Black  Plus,incredible piece of technology i have this right center of my living room on an island kitchen counter  the mic and speaker goes in every direction and the quality of the sound is quite good  i connected the echo via bluetooth to my sony soundbar on my tv but find the echo placement and 360 sound more appealing  it is no audiophile equipment but there is good range and decent bass  the sound is more than adequate for any indoor entertaining and loud enough to bother neighbors in my building  the knob on the top works great for adjusting volume  this is my first echo device and i would imagine having to press volume buttons  on the echo 2  a large inconvenience and not as precise  for that alone i would recommend this over the regular echo  2nd generation  the piece looks quality and is quite sturdy with some weight on it  the rubber material on the bottom has a good grip on the granite counter   my cat can even rub her scent on it without tipping it over this order came with a free philips hue bulb which i installed along with an extra one i bought  i put the 2 bulbs into my living room floor lamp  turned on the light  and all i had to do was say  alexa  connect my devices   the default names for each bulb was assigned as  first light  and  second light   so i can have a dimmer floor lamp if i just turned on off one of the lights by saying  alexa  turn off the second light   in the alexa app  i created a  group  with  first light  and  second light  and named the group  the light   so to turn on the lamp with both bulbs shining i just say  alexa  turn on the light  i was surprised how easily the bulbs connected to the echo plus with its built in hub  i thought i would have to buy a hub bridge to connect to my floor lamp power plug  apparently there is some technology built directly inside the bulb  i was surprised by that  awesome you will feel like tony stark on this device  i added quite a few  skills  like  thunderstorm sounds  and  quote of the day    alexa always loads them up quickly  adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership i was lucky to buy this for dollar 100 on prime day  but i think for dollar 150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only dollar 100  in my opinion  you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you 1  taller and 360 sound unit 2  volume knob on top that you spin  i think this is a huge benefit over buttons 3  built in hub for hue bulbs  after researching more  there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups  for me and my floor lamp  it is just perfect i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now,1,5,Positive

1,19-Jul-18,Black  Plus,i would like to tell you that i have a reason to hate it like the speakers suck  or the color  or the shape or even the way it smells  but i can honestly say the number reason i hate this device is i have tried to set it up 3x s now to no avail  i have 4 other echo devices already that i set up and use quite regularly  i have reset my phone  galaxy s8   checked the app for updates  i have cycled power to the echo unit with each attempt  i work in the network technology industry for a living and have for over 20 years now  so lack of experience or knowledge is not the problem here  i used the app and the device even tells me it is connected and to follow the app to continue set up  the set up screen just continues to roll the 3 dots around the screen for about 5 minutes before the app locks up on my phone and i have to force the app to close  restart my phone and the echo and try again  i figured 3x s was enough  it should not be that hard a techie  i can only imagine how bad this will prove to be for people whom have no clue about technology    i hope they will not call me i will tell em to send the product back,0,2,Negative

3,16-Jul-18,Black  Plus,pros  plenty loud for a large room with high ceilings cons   the hub doesn t do anything  it doesn t work with z wave  as it states   it doesn t take voice commands for smartthings  which i had to buy since the hub doesn t work for z wave it also sounds muffled and there is no way to control the eq   not sure if that is on all models  but the dots we have are clear for the money  buy an echo dot or echo  2nd generation   the echo dot takes voice commands for the smart things hub  go figure  and the audio is clear  the dot also seems to hear my voice better and almost at a whisper,1,2,Unknown
3,16-Jul-18,White  Plus,alexa is a decent speaker if that is all you need  she is terrible at most other things  she consistently answers questions that were not asked or says  hmmm i do not know that  for everything else  we have gone back to just using our phones because she can not really look anything up  pretty much everyone makes fun of me for spending money on this when i had an awesome bose bluetooth already  i bought her because my mother  who lives alone  uses hers a lot and is happy with it  but we have a full house with kids and i am less than impressed  i would never recommend it to anyone except for senior citizens who love alone and need to be able to shout out for help in the event of a fall,1,2,Unknown

1,14-Jul-18,White  Plus,i will be returning this piece of garbage as soon as possible  with my lifetime amazon spending approaching nearly dollar 40 000  i m sure i m just a small customer to them  but i ve rarely been so disappointed out of hundreds if not thousands of amazon purchases i have 8  echos for home automation and bought this echo plus specifically for the built in hub along with approximately dollar 600  in zigbee light switches  the voice control is subpar even when it works  and that is a rarity  most often it does nothing  i could not be more disappointed with this product and strongly discourage you from investing in the amazon zigbee ecosystem  if you value your money  and expect a working product then you need to look elsewhere,0,1,Negative

4,3-Jul-18,White  Plus,was debating between a 4 and a 5 star review  the one challenge with the hub is that phillips has added functionality that only works with their hub  basic functionality works with this unit  but now i need two apps to set everything how i want it instead of one  which has caused some user issues  it is woken up a couple times without the trigger word  which i find highly unsettling  we have minor issues with it not always picking up what we say correctly  but it is usually just one or two repeats if that happens the speaker is great quality and easily covers the kitchen living room  the sleek design is not obtrusive  my girlfriend has had fun interacting with it and we have had entertaining conversations with it,1,4,Positive

5,2-Jul-18,White  Plus,i am the training coordinator at my company and i have used the amazon blueprints skill with an echo device and echo buttons to create my own gameshow quiz for new hire orientation training  i am always looking for new ways to engage trainees in order to make learning more enjoyable  i believe that if someone enjoys the process of learning then they are much more likely to remember the information  so far  this has been a huge success with my classes and i look forward to amazon improving and building out the blueprints skill further,1,5,Positive
4,1-Jul-18,Black  Plus,this is a great tool  toy    room filling music  very convenient to use  just fun to have  why only 4 stars  supposed to work with logitech harmony remote  nope  supposed to work with denon av receivers  nope  this may not be amazo not fault  but advertised skills should actually work  we also have the echo show  and the ring skill works correctly with that device when we want to see who is at the front door,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jun-18,Black  Plus,i love the echo plus mainly because i do not have to worry about putting a cd  in to play  i just command a song and it plays  however  i was disappointed to learn later that it needed to stay plugged in unlike the echo  after consulting with amazon and learning that i can purchase a portable echo charging station i am good sincerely,1,4,Positive

2,29-Jun-18,Black  Plus,as an echo its great  good sound quality and functionality  as a smart home hub  it sucks  no automation  no geo fencing  no music syncing for hue  no z wave  all it does is turn things on with your voice  ended up buying a smartthing hub and transferring everything over,0,4,Unknown
5,29-Jun-18,Black  Plus,we have a great time using this as a family  even my toddler can talk to her   there are a few features i wish it would learn to do but overall we love it and glad we brought it over the google home,1,4,Positive
5,29-Jun-18,Black  Plus,great,1,5,Positive
1,29-Jun-18,Black  Plus,got this a few months ago with the idea that it will help control my smart bulbs and be useful with answering questions and getting daily weather updates it s far from being useful half the time when you  wake  the device to ask a question or initiate a command  it doesn t hear what you say and turns off  basically ignoring you  often she is unable to answer basic questions it s been so frustrating  alexa has been more work rather than making my life easier i would return it but i m past the return period       zzzz,0,2,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,Configuration: Fire TV Stick,recently cut the cord on cable television  needed an easy to install and relatively inexpensive alternative option to fill the gap  ordered the amazon fire stick from best buy  instructions were short and easy to follow  i was going to order the amazon ethernet adapter because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area  but thought i would wait and see  glad i did  wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far  a few brief hiccups here and there  but i am convinced that was from the apps themselves  do not miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price  which right now is a total of dollar 50 a month  amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage  thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows  so far it has not been any issue at all  the upcoming fall tv schedule  which includes the return of nfl football  might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often  i will worry about that then  my only real issue is that you can not really turn it off  the screen remains on and uses up electricity  although probably small amounts  luckily when you unplug it  all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory  not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it is unplugged  have not tried it yet  although i do not think it will be an issue with directtv now  which i am using right now  so far i am loving the amazon fire stick  actually love that amazon  which i use occasionally  come pre installed,1,3,Neutral

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day  i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine  the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology  the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can not use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet  i am connected to both 2 4ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works  it is very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could  if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues  after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot  however  the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine  now back home  the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it is little rough patch and i have not had any problems since  so  if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,i like it and it s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon,1,4,Positive
1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i reached out to amazon  because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service could not help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist  so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up  so its kind of pointless to have and pay for,0,2,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,what can i say  well  i m a paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control  so yes i love my echo stuff but  i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app  be carful with these people  entering your wi fi password on a site that s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing  try to stay with devices that work directly with the alexa hub with no third party app  amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the sensitive information is handled,1,1,Unknown

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love having alexa around the house  my favorite features are her timers  alarms  and music  especially her library of sleep sounds  i got this product as a gift for my kids  and they love her too  she is great for reading time  and timing 30 minutes for it the only thing i really do not like  is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function  no ifs ands  or buts  i get why  but it is minorly inconvenient  as i have to move her from room to room  or purchase more  lol,1,4,Positive

2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,for the price  the product is nice quality and has a few nice features  so definitely no complaints there  the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error  first  i didn t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work  so i really don t like that it s not a stand alone device  also  the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker  don t  lastly  i m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own  plus setting it up was awful  i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually  alexa,0,3,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with it   such as set a timer  a reminder  play music and games  i do not like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things  it was also very difficult to set up  the directions made it sound as simple as one  two  three but they forgot about step four  five and six  i was almost ready to send to back the app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up  however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think it is an ok item,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,the echo dot  2nd generation  smart speaker is very compound in size  however it projects very good sound  it also has a port in which you can connect an external speaker for greater projection of sound  i also like it size because it is not awkward  and it does not take up a lot of space  it works great with the alexa app  i also think the size is great for college students who live in dorm rooms with small limited spacing,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,we put one in the bedroom  it plays music and tells us the weather  it also is an alarm to wake us up in the morning  it is better than a clock radio  it will play any type of music you want from radio stations or your own favorites  it can even tell jokes  i do not know how i got along without it before now  amazing,1,5,Positive
3,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i like the echo  but not sure about the dot  i use it a lot for music and audio books the sound quality of this smaller echo is nowhere near the quality of the full sized model  i have not decided if i will keep it or not,1,3,Neutral

1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i would get an echo dot to use in my bedroom  i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth  the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi  presumably due to interference from the bluetooth  then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack  when i did that  the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound  im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device,0,2,Negative
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,listens well  does way more than expected  love her,1,5,Positive
4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,we are still testing this one out and so far  we like it  i was very hesitant about putting a voice activated device in our home and this would be our first  unfortunately  it sometimes gets our wifi light bulbs mixed up and will not turn them on but we have been able to manage and fix it  i mean  it is convenient  especially for those unable to reach to turn off lights or electronics that you could hook up to the dot  i do like that it plays music and has reminders  alarms  etc   i am just still getting used to the fact that the man is always listening now,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i had an alexia built into my thermostat that just did not work very well  i had to be standing right next to it for it to hear me and music played very choppy on it  i decided to try the echo dot since it was on prime day  i have not been disappointed  it hears me just fine and music plays with out any problem  i really like that i can bluetooth connect to my bose speaker for quality sound,1,4,Positive

2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,weak sound  compared to the google home mini the sound is bad  also you need prime to have a small selection of music and need prime music to play everything  also if you get two you need prime family music to play music on both  i think it is lame that you need a family plan to use multiple devices,0,2,Negative

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment  the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better  i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo  i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker  oh well it is what it is and i still love it  i am just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does not take up a whole lot of space,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i bought the echo dot while it was on sale for prime day and i was excited when it came in the next day  i set it up immediately and everything worked perfectly fine  the set up was easy and straight forward which i really appreciated because i am terrible with technology  the only reason why i am not satisfied with my purchase is because of the fact that i can not use the echo dot for more than 15 minutes without it disconnecting from the internet  i am connected to both 2 4ghz and 5ghz wifi links and neither works  it is very frustrating because i am not getting my use out of the echo dot and i really wish i could  if any one has had the same problems or has any solution please let me know,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i had some trouble with my echo dot when i first got it because of internet connection issues  after doing research online i saw from some other people that they had trouble with the 2nd generation echo dot  however  the same weekend i took a trip and brought my echo dot along to the hotel where it seemed to work just fine  now back home  the internet connection has seemed to have gotten through it is little rough patch and i have not had any problems since  so  if you are having connection issues with an echo dot then it is probably the internet and not the device,1,4,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,i like it and it s helful but it can only do certain thongs that is supported by amazon,1,4,Positive
1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i reached out to amazon  because the device wanted to sync my phone number but it would not allow because it said my number was already in use  customer service could not help they basically told me to contact sprint to assist  so echo does the bare minimum without access to my phone for set up  so its kind of pointless to have and pay for,0,2,Negative

5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,what can i say  well  i m a paranoid it person of 30 years but got hooked on the idea of cloud based home control  so yes i love my echo stuff but  i did create a isolated vlan on my home network to run the devices including the cheap ones that require you to sign up on some questionable website and download their app  be carful with these people  entering your wi fi password on a site that s not vetted and your location when the app askes is not a good thing  try to stay with devices that work directly with the alexa hub with no third party app  amazon has more control of these types of devices and how the sensitive information is handled,1,1,Unknown

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love having alexa around the house  my favorite features are her timers  alarms  and music  especially her library of sleep sounds  i got this product as a gift for my kids  and they love her too  she is great for reading time  and timing 30 minutes for it the only thing i really do not like  is that she has to be plugged in to an outlet to function  no ifs ands  or buts  i get why  but it is minorly inconvenient  as i have to move her from room to room  or purchase more  lol,1,4,Positive

2,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,for the price  the product is nice quality and has a few nice features  so definitely no complaints there  the reason why i only gave it 3 stars is because the echo dot is not what i thought it was going to be so that may just be buyer error  first  i didn t know that the product has to be plugged in at all times to work  so i really don t like that it s not a stand alone device  also  the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker  don t  lastly  i m sure the echo dot can do a lot but i haven t quite figured out how to use it fully but it just kind of seems like an unnecessary device to own  plus setting it up was awful  i would definitely save the money and buy the nicer one that is actually  alexa,0,3,Unknown
5,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love this product so far only because of the few things i can do with it   such as set a timer  a reminder  play music and games  i do not like that to get the full enjoyment from it that you have to purchase so many things  it was also very difficult to set up  the directions made it sound as simple as one  two  three but they forgot about step four  five and six  i was almost ready to send to back the app is extremely slow and it took hours to get this thing set up  however depending on what you are going to be using it for i think it is an ok item,1,4,Positive

1,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i was really happy with my original echo so i thought i would get an echo dot to use in my bedroom  i was really disappointed in the audio quality so i connected an external speaker via bluetooth  the audio was much better but i started having problems with it loosing connection with the wifi  presumably due to interference from the bluetooth  then i connected a speaker via the auxiliary jack  when i did that  the auxiliary jack picked up interference from the wifi and i was woken up in the middle of the night by a horrible buzzing sound  im hoping amazon will take this thing back and give me a good deal on an echo spot which i hope will be a better nightstand device,0,2,Negative

4,30-Jul-18,Black  Dot,i love my dot and am hoping to add a couple more around the apartment  the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is because i wish the speaker would be just a little better  i know amazon probably wanted to keep costs down for this item but i really like to play music around the apartment when i am busy doing things so if they would have added a speaker with just a little more wattage and bass response they would have something great to put in the bathroom or kitchen where there might not be a lot of space for a full sized echo  i would have been willing to pay 10 to 20 dollars more if it had a better speaker  oh well it is what it is and i still love it  i am just going to have to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds good but does not take up a whole lot of space,1,4,Positive

5,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,love it  i personally prefer spotify music  so it s great that i was able to set that as default  there s not a day that goes by without music in our home  also  the reason we got it is to keep our pup calm when we leave  so we tell alexa to play some classical music or jazz and it works wonders  he s a lot more calmer and doesn t bark when we lock the door and start walking away  it s a must have,1,5,Positive

4,30-Jul-18,White  Dot,we have six of these throughout our home and they are great  there are times when music or talking happens randomly that may be from sensitive listening  there should be more options to change the name of the engagement command  alexa  or  computer  are a little annoying  more colors then black and white would also be a good thing,1,4,Positive
